Worst of all, The Last Key seems to feel the need to remind of you of the other Insidious films and previous scenes with needless flashbacks and reincorporation. The humor is often misplaced, pacing is disjointed, but at least the score will be sure to remind you of when you're supposed to be scared.Despite some cool looking sets, there is little to enjoy in this film.

This one does have some good elements in it, and definitely more of the bad ones. All in all, the film felt like a below average \"horror\" film. This film really felt underwhelming to me, and I already had very less expectations. If the franchise is to proceed further (no pun intended), they need to change the direction or reboot it. But the best thing would be to stop it right here. On my own scale, I would give it a \"4.1/10\" score. And on the usual A+ to F scale, it would get a \"D+\".(Discussion about how I personally felt about the movie)Good : What this film does good is it adds some more depth to the character of Elise. They give the back story and all, along with some \"origins\" of Elise. Her character moments are quite good. Some jump-scares, particularly one or two, were good ones. And ... that's it. Mixed : None of the parts were \"mixed\", just good or bad. Bad : The remaining of the film, just like the third one, felt more like a typical \"haunted house\" story, rather than an \"Insidious\" film. The concept of astral projection they brought in the first film has been turned into a mere plot device ever since the third one, this fourth installment clearly isn't an exception. Honestly, I feel that is the thing that made the first two films what they were. And the way \"The Further\" works has been quite a bit ludicrous ever since the second one, the ludicrousness increased in the third one and now in this one, everything convenient to the plot can be done in \"The Further\". Just like astral projection, this is just a plot device now. And nothing is explained about how the things work to stop that demon. It was just \"you're watching a horror film, so anything that we do for our convenience, you should accept it, no matter we build it or not\" sort of bullshit. The jokes that the two \"sidekicks\" of Elise crack were CRINGE-WORTHY. Just some perverted moments time and again, some unnecessary bullshit, most of the comedic parts feel out of place and did not match the tone of the film. And even though the jokes and all that stupid stuff felt out of place, this film felt like a comedy more than horror. Speaking of horror, it just had jump-scares, none of which made a real sense. Remove them, nothing is \"horror\". Also, some predictable and obvious \"Insidious\" twists at some places, which no longer feel appealing. Also, \"The Last Key\" ..... I am still wondering what was so special about the key, except for Elise giving the demon the last key. It was just a demon who manipulated Elise's father and had fingers made up of keys which served some vague purpose not explained in the movie. The demon when appears in some jump-scares, it scares (at least). But when it really shows up, nothing is speacial about it. So, where's the horror? Scaring and terrifying are different things, and for a good horror film, most of us prefer the terrifying stuffs. The presence of demon serves no purpose? And he's the only demon?!! And how is that blowing a whistle calls Elise's mother to rescue her and a single kick kills the demon? (If only it had some purpose and some story added to the part of the demon like in the first two, it might have worked.) Also, what's with her Elise's dad's spirit dying in \"The Further\"? There are many such questions unanswered by the film and this is not obviously an \"Inception-themed\" or \"Memento-themed\" movie, this was just an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Then, there's a scene of Elise opening the boxes to realize the killings her father committed, where we were teased of jump-scares, and we didn't get a jump-scare at the first time, and after a couple of stupid teasings we get a jump-scare. And if the makers thought we won't be able to predict what they were doing in this scene, they're fools. See? A scene committed to an unnecessary jump-scare, but nothing done to give some actual horror. Doesn't that prove that horror film makers don't know what horror is? And where's that man dressed as bride in a black dress trying to kill Elise, which was supposed to follow her every time she went into \"The Further\"? The film ties up with the events of the first one, which clearly creates some plot holes as the entire film was about astral projection but the way this film ties it up shows as if it was something similar to this film, making this more of a nonsense. In fact, the best part of this film is that it had some scenes from the first Insidious film, which reminded me how good the first two were. Rest of all, unnecessary crap.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It's not the best installment out of the entire franchise but it's a decent prequel that serves its purpose and that is to put further spotlight on the legacy of one of horror genre's most underrated icons, actress Lin Shaye.Brought to you by the same creative minds behind \"Insidious\" trilogy, this fourth installment, Insidious: The Last Key takes you back to the beginning, to the family history of renowned parapsychologist, Dr. Elise Rainer and how the haunting in her own family home has returned with a vengeance. It is up to Elise and her spectral sighting team to defeat this demon once and for all. Even though Insidious: The Last Key is directed by somebody new to the franchise, Adam Robitel, much of the style follows suit with its predecessors, so in a way, this movie is very formulaic, the objective is the same which is to present to you a big bad villain in a form of a demon at the end of the story and that's not really a spoiler because the other movies did the same thing. Because this is a prequel, it takes its time in setting the whole thing up in terms of Elise's family and the abuse she and her brother endured when they were kids. This part, these flashbacks are just as creepy, if not creepier than what's happening in the present day with Elise trying to communicate with spirits in the dark. By the way, actress Lin Shaye has been in this business and specifically has been part of this genre forever, so as a fan, it really is cool to see a movie like this that allows her to showcase her all, that gives her room and space to do what she does best, in a way, they might as well have titled this movie, Insidious The Lin Shaye lifetime achievement award.I actually enjoyed how the film presents Elise's background, the whole theme of it kinda resonates with any kid who grows up feeling different and the parents try to beat it out of you instead of helping you embrace your specialty and uniqueness. So that approach does help in making you empathize with Elise which is an effective strategy in any horror film because the jump scares can only do so much, what's truly scary is when you feel scared for the safety of the characters whose journey you've been following, and that's what Insidious: The Last Key offers. I'm also mildly amused by the comic relief of Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson who play Elise's sidekicks, granted some of the humor does feel a bit dumb but they mean well, so it's one of those that just make you shake your head and dismiss them as immature children. Insidious The Last Key is scary enough, it's entertaining enough for the fans, it's a popcorn horror thriller you'd want to take your girlfriend to see just so that she can curl up next to you when she feels squeamish, this really is a movie just for the fans of the franchise, and despite some of its few ridiculous scenes, I think overall they're going to be grateful that this installment exists.-- Rama's Screen --", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It was written and directed by Maysaloun Hamoud.Three Palestinian women live in an apartment in Tel Aviv. Two of them (Leila Bakhr and Salma) have more or less abandoned traditional values. They drink, smoke, attend raves, and do coke. We assume that their love lives also don't correspond to traditional values, although that is implied, not stated.The third woman is Noor, who is striving to maintain tradition. Noor is engaged to be married to a man who grudgingly accepts that fact that she is a computer scientist, but would much rather she stay at home once they are married. Not a good sign. The plot revolves around all three of the women, but especially Noor. Three exceptional actors portray the women. Mouna Hawa plays Leila Bakhr, Sana Jammelieh is Salma, and Shaden Kanboura plays Noor. All three women are strong actors, but I was especially impressed by Shaden Kanboura.I have to admit that, although I'm hardly a traditionalist, I wish that women who want to cast off tradition could find less toxic ways of demonstrating their independence. (One of my friends says that this is the point--if you want to cast off tradition, you cast it off and take any path you like, including toxic paths.) I see his point, but smoking will still take ten years off their non-traditional lives.We saw this film at the beautiful JCC Hart Theater as part of the Rochester International Jewish Film Festival. This is always an excellent festival, but it has been even better this year. The festival is almost over as I write this review. We've seen eight films of the ten we plan to see, and I've given every one of the eight an IMDb rating of 9 or 10. If you live in Upstate New York, get on the RIJFF mailing list, because some of the movies will be re-shown later in the year. Also, if you love movies, plan to attend the RIJFF in 2018.

Any base that they may seem to have established for themselves \"in between\" seems to crumble beneath their feet.Despite the serious predicament, though, the movie is also very much about sisters doing it for themselves. There's an automatic solidarity whereby women-- at least young women of similar ages-- are all automatically soulmates; and men, it almost goes without saying, are swine. (Well, the gay guy is of course okay and a bit amusing.) Despite those stereotypes, the movie holds interest by virtue of believable acting and believable situations. My wife says it's one of the best we've seen in recent years, and she had the chance to appreciate it a little better than I did not only because she's a woman but also because she understands Arabic somewhat. For those who don't understand Arabic, though, there's still the added benefit of a look into another culture. The Israeli press was particularly impressed that not only traditional Arabic life is glimpsed, but also the small, rarely-explored community of young Arabs in Tel Aviv. (Is it possible that they all really smoke that much?) We see a succession of situations that by no means always involve much action or even much tension, although a couple of crises do come up. Mostly the appeal of the movie is in allowing us to feel like a fly on the wall among interesting people facing interesting day-to-day challenges.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The movie begins with an older woman waxing a young female leg and sharing advice: \"Don't raise your voice, men don't like women who raise their voices. Remember to always say a kind word, and cook him good food. Don't forget to put on perfume and to keep your body smooth so that he desires you.\"Music then explodes and we're at a wild, co-ed, bachelorette party in Tel Aviv with drinking, drugs, and dancing\u2014the central characters' regular singles backdrop. Beautiful Laila (Mouna Hawa) with long curly locks and a cigarette always in hand, appears bored with this dating scene. Back home the next day, she and her housemate Salma (Sana Jammelieh ) meet an unexpected visitor, Noar (Shaden Kanboura), who's come to stay with them until she can find her own apartment. Noar explains that her cousin Rafif\u2014Laila and Salma's absent roommate\u2014 said it would be all right. These few opening scenes set the stage for a look at the experience of young Palestinian-Israeli women in today's urbane Tel Aviv. Laila's a non-religious feminist lawyer, Salma's a fringe DJ from a Christian family, and Noar's a senior at the university and wears full Islamic garb.Through each of the women's stories related to their love lives, the film explores male domination, male attitudes toward women, and male abuses when their authority is crossed. Although the film focuses on experiences in today's diverse Palestinian-Israeli culture, the treatment of Laila, Salma, and Noar is universal. The take-away, as the three women process the denouements of their relationships, is sad, to both them and to us: Men (or most), from lovers to fathers, just don't get it, they can't see it, so they can't change. As if cemented into their behavioral genes, the men in the film (with parallels in other cultures) believe they are right about their entitlement to dominate\u2014to tell women how to dress modestly, to not smoke, to stay at home with the kids\u2014or to abuse them if the women resist. Women in the audience of this important movie freeze at moments when Laila, Salma, or Noar stand up for themselves to their men. We freeze fearing a physical blow, a bashing silencer instead of meaningful conversation. How do men in the audience feel during these tense, cowering moments? Undoubtedly the same. Then why can't recognition of the problem on the screen translate to real-life consciousness about equality?We witness one atrocious punishment against Noar by her fianc\u00e9 Wissam (and compliments to Henry Andrawas for playing such a horrid role). The camera and audio focus intently on Wissam's zipper going back up after he's committed his brute crime of authority, and this focus makes the audience think how a man's \"instrument of lovemaking\" also serves as a violent weapon. The three women helping each other through their relationship traumas give the audience another universal: women support, comfort, and work for each other and always have, and this community based on gender solidarity is the basis for their strength\u2014their stamina, wisdom, friendship, and bedrock role in all societies. These qualities, so deep in women, contrast to the male strength of body and physical force. Thus the movie honors women but cannot say there will ever be changes in their relationships with men.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The story has been altered a good deal but it is still recognizably based on an event that occurred in 2001. They have based the movie on the story of Derek and Alex King who came under the spell of a neighboring pedophile who recognized their thirst for attention and desire for a male role model's attention. The boys were only 12 and 13 years old at the time and they had been bounced around foster homes and family members for a good while and had not lived together during those times. When a neighbor, who was a friend of their fathers, began watching over them while their father was away and began showering them with attention and gifts and treats they never got in any other case, the boys quickly fell under his spell. It all ended with the boys being molested and under the neighbors spell and with his direction one of the boys killed his father with a baseball bat while he sat in a chair. For the details and more complete actual story you can simply do a search of their names, Alex and Derek King.\nThe movie loosely follows what happened while changing numerous details such as using only 1 boy and having the neighbor pedophile shot dead in an exchange with law enforcement. In reality he received a 30 year prison sentence and the boys received 7 and 8 year sentences, incarcerating them until they became adults.\nI have seen that some watchers thought the movie went to slow but I fail to see that. I was also some what surprised to not see any indication about it being based on a real incident. Perhaps because the boys were young minors at the time. I myself was fascinated by the movie and I recognized the the association with actual events after only a few minutes. I would suggest that perhaps viewers might want to read about the actual event after watching the movie. The movie depicts the terrible cost that pedophiles inflict upon their victims, both immediate and through out their lives. I see the movie as a cautionary tale of what can happen when we fail to treat our kids as human beings and as the most important things we have.

Co-directors Christopher Radcliff and Lauren Wolkstein have expanded their 2011 short film into their first feature length film, and though some evidence of 'stretching' is present, so is a somber, moody style that provides an interesting look and feel.It's more mysterious and atmospheric than it is thriller, and at times it even has a \"Twilight Zone\" vibe. Nick (Alex Pettyfer) and Sam (James Freedson-Jackson) are traveling together as brothers, though we never really believe they are related. An impending dread hovers around each move they make, and the film tortures/teases us with unspecified relationships and connections. Nick and Sam are semi-desperate and clearly on the run, yet it's not until the end when things somewhat come together. Young Freedson-Jackson is the key to the film, and his facial reactions are critical. His astounding blank stares seem to hold meaning. It's a bleak film with a gloomy tone, and while I'm all for slow and deliberate story-telling, the technique is usually more effective when there is a reason for it.

Where, say, 'Le Samourai' exists in a sparse, abstract, geometric, dreamlike Paris, the Montmartre of 'Bob' in vibrantly alive, with its nightclubs, bars, stray GIs, petty hoods, casual sex, late-night gambling.  Where in 'Samourai', the hero's character is pared down to psychological abstraction, Bob is a recognisable human being, stern, but sweet, honourable, a Chandlerian knight, with back-history and motivation.  Other characters are plausible, if elusive, also.  Where 'Samourai' is a masterpiece of tone, in which direction, acting, cinematography, narrative, sound, colour, decor all cohere into a perfect whole, 'Bob' is a riot of clashing modes, more reminiscent of the gleeful iconoclasm of the nouvelle vague - parody and action, humour and seriousness, dream and realism, co-exist in fertile, thrilling tension.The hero is what the title suggests, a man who can't stop gambling, moving from one late-night backroom poker-game to another, betting most of his money on horse-races, leaving his diet to a throw of the dice; he even has a fruit machine in his well-appointed flat, where his art collection seems to consist of framed carpet.  Yet, ironically, he is a methodical man, keeping to the same routine, the same hours, one night losing a fortune, another making one.  Gambling is his only vice now; formerly a con, he did time 20 years previously for a failed bank job - he now considers himself too old for the criminal grind.After one particularly unprofitable spree, and a chance conversation with a pimp-turned-croupier, Bob and an old friend decide to rob the casino safe at Deauville, and begin rounding up the usual experts and investors, minutely orchestrating the heist.  Almost immediately the plans fall through - the dissatisfied wife of the inside man informs the police, as does a thug Bob once refused to help.  The casino boss is informed, the police lie in waiting.  And yet Bob goes ahead...For a man who took his pseudonym from one of the great novelists; who adapted most of his films (including 'Bob') from books; and who wrote his own screenplays, Melville has little patience with words, and the story of Bob is brilliantly encapsulated in a series of establishing images.  The opening narration eulogises Montmartre with shots defining milieu in realistic terms.  yet, when we first see Bob, he is in a setting of extreme artifice, with symbolic chess walls (a recurring pattern) and pictures of, rather than actual, locations.  He puts on his trenchcoat and fedora, his signs of movie criminality; whereas Jimmy Cagney and Humphrey Bogart's characters WERE gangsters by their deeds, Bob plays the role of a gangster just as Ledru plays the role of a cop, and  Anne plays the role of vamp or femme fatale - they are recognisably human behind their 'types', but, in this world made of movies, they cannot do the sensible, plausible thing, but are locked into their roles, despite Ledru's humanistic insistence otherwise.  Sense would tell Bob to give up the heist; his pre-ordained role means that he cannot.As he walks in the early dawn at the beginning, he looks into a tarnished mirror, a further visualisation of the difference between one's self and one's role, identity etc.  In an extraordinary long shot, the road-sprayer that circles Bob is echoed in the circular shapes of a nearby park, echoing the circles of the film, the vicious circle Bob gets trapped in, the circles of the casino, the cycles of life.  He watches as Anne is picked up by an American motorcyclist - Bob as helpless observer; the movie will dramatise the various ill-fated ways in which he will try to move from passive to active, to stop being a pawn of fate; the frequent, unmotivated-angle shots undermine this.  Like all Melville's films, this is not the story of a gangster, but a dismantling of all the concealed codes, ideologies, assumptions, of the gangster, of masculinity, of Hollywood cinema.One of the ways 'Bob'  breaks with traditional cinema is in its anti-Oedipal bias. ; A conventional film often uses an Oedipal trajectory, usually showing an immature hero's moral progress, often defeating an older figure, taking his place and power, and winning the girl.  This is a necessary process of continuity for the social order.  And this seems to be fulfilled here, as Paolo, who hero-worships Bob, obeying him like a father, takes his place, takes his girl, takes his apartment to have the sex Bob can't have anymore, even using Bob's gestures.  Bob is a shadow of himself, de trop in his own home.  As it should be.  The subsequent narrative could be seen as an attempt of Bob's to regain his identity and power, and to emasculate Paolo.This sublime film is full of little twists of the norm like this.  Isabelle Corey is unprecedented among all film heroines, her amoral, seemingly indifferent sexuality far more suggestive and powerful than her contemporary, Bardot's - her fulfilling her femme fatale role does not result in tragedy any more than Bob's fulfilling his gangster role does.\nThe use of the narrator is interesting too; voiced by Melville, creator of the film, he is also a kind of God-creator, talking about heaven and hell, taking us on a journey from one to the other; talking from the darkness, about how lives cross, but destinies don't meet, than creating a work where crossed destinies are crucial; intruding at bizarre moments, with prior knowledge of the characters' fates before the action has actually determined them.  This, of course, dissipates tension, as does the clownish music, mocking and undermining as much as it propels the action, and the characters' theatricality, their awareness of their roles (eg the rehearsals for the heist like a play).The filming of this goes way beyond Melville's heist models, 'The Asphalt Jungle' (his favourite movie) and 'Rififi' - after all the plot elements have been put in place - the plan, the preparations, the tip-off, the suspense - Melville moves to a completely different register, and what had been a crime film involving many interested parties becomes a solitary, private rite, Bob's gambling in the casino is a heightened, hallucinatory dream, not quite a rite of death, but a rite of middle-age, of letting go the trappings of youth, also paving the way for the great climax of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly': the shoot-out is pure, beautiful, dream abstraction.For many, great cinema is defined in rarefied terms of high art, snobbily above the detritus of popular culture.  For some of us, though, great cinema means a transformative enriching and expanding of popular genres, a cinema that can speak to everybody, not above them, but making the familiar strange.  Keaton.

He and a couple of friends find a rich backer to put up the money necessary to pull such a large heist and then Bob (the gambler) decides to enlist some others to help out. In the end, he has involved not 9, not 10, but 11 people in the heist. Sound familiar. This hugely influential film by Jean-Pierre Melville has spawned both versions of Ocean's 11 and is also often credited as the grandfather of the Nouvelle Vague movement. This movie is French, so unlike the American versions of Ocean's Eleven, there is no singing, no laughing, no hi-fiving, just straight-faced gambling, plotting and even the loving is grim and made without a smile. The characters are memorable, especially Bob and Anne as they go through life expecting no happiness. Bob never goes to bed before 6am, as he spends his nights, every night, gambling at different locations. This addiction is part of who he is and plays a key role in the twist at the end.This movie is like a good strong Camembert. As with many French movies, definitely an acquired taste, but once one learns to appreciate the sharpness, one realizes that there is nothing comparable. Camembert, unlike bacon, is not the food of joy. But it is good, flavorful, and powerful in making one want to partake again and again. Until you feel the tanginess in your mouth, there is no describing the taste or effect, but it is definitely worth the effort to build an appreciation for it. 8/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt0047892", "movieTitle": "Bob le Flambeur", "title": "BOB LE FLAMBEUR (1955) - DVD Review", "author": "MARIO GAUCI", "postedDate": "13 June 2004", "reviewContent": "Yesterday I have watched Jean-Pierre Melville's BOB LE FLAMBEUR (1955) for the first time, by way of Criterion's exemplary DVD edition. The film is a typical 50s French noir in its presentation of divided loyalties among a gang of crooks, women causing trouble, an elaborate heist-gone-wrong, police interrogation, etc. With this, Melville's first outing in a genre he later made his own, the director shows he is already at one with the milieu, capturing its every nuance and mannerism with almost effortless ease.The cast is relatively low-key but all the main roles are admirably filled. Unfortunately, none went on to do much else of importance (apart from Howard Vernon) - and it was, in fact, lead actor Roger Duchesne's penultimate film. Looking a bit like Rudolf Klein-Rogge (who as Dr. Mabuse also played a gambling crime lord), he exudes a smooth charisma and is quite arresting in his playing. Isabel Corey, still a teenager but looking incredibly sexy and mature, was literally hand-picked by Melville himself for the role of Anne, the lovely waif whom Bob takes under his wing but whose inexperience eventually leads, in part, to his downfall. The film also makes brief yet subtle use of nudity which, at that time, was not something one would hope to find in American movies! Daniel Cauchy as Paulo, Bob's right-hand man who also falls for Corey, acquits himself well too here and, on the DVD, delivers an intelligent and delightful 20-minute interview which gives some insight into Melville's working methods, the film's pain-staking shooting schedule (it took some two years to complete during which time Cauchy found time to appear in another four movies!) and also the director's insistence in portraying the 'correct' way of dying on screen. Howard Vernon has a brief but pivotal role as the shady Scotsman who offers to finance Bob's 'scheme'.Apart from the usual conventions of typical French crime dramas, BOB LE FLAMBEUR introduces some new forms of technique which anticipated the off-the-cuff style of the Nouvelle Vague by some years: the editing has a strange, almost disjointed rhythm to it which is particularly felt near the end during the long gambling sequence at the casino; the hand-held camera-work lends it a slightly amateurish look which suits the mood perfectly; a vaguely avant-gardist touch is also evident in the set design, as in the domino-styled walls of the gambling-dens Bob frequents and the closet in his apartment that is fitted with a privately-owned slot machine! Another interesting aspect (derived perhaps from Julien Duvivier's PEPE' LE MOKO [1936]) is the mutual admiration that is present between Bob and the Police Inspector played by Guy Decomble.Unlike most of Melville's other work, and particularly his film noirs, the gloomy 'atmosphere' is here counter-pointed by a deft playful mood that makes the film extremely enjoyable despite its fairly slow pace. The film's conclusion then, improbable as it may seem, provides a perfect and deliciously ironic twist - complete with a wonderful closing line.Criterion's DVD also includes a rather vague radio interview, conducted in English in 1961, with Jean-Pierre Melville who is made distinctly uneasy by interviewer Gideon Bachmann's frustratingly opaque questions. We learn, however, of Melville's great love of American cinema as well as his own work's belated but well-deserved international recognition. I have now watched 8 of Melville's films - LES ENFANTS TERRIBLES (1950); BOB LE FLAMBEUR; LEON MORIN, PRETRE (1961 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); LE DOULOS (1962 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); L' AINE' DES FERCHEAUX (1963); LE SAMOURAI (1967); L' ARMEE' DES OMBRES (1969 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion); and UN FLIC (1972 - I still haven't gotten round to purchasing the Anchor Bay R1 DVD). I haven't yet watched LE CERCLE ROUGE (1970 - possibly forthcoming on DVD from Criterion) which I own on VHS, but I may just check it out now that I'm in the mood for more Melville movies!", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

An influence on everyone from Godard and Truffaut to Paul Thomas Anderson.", "author": "Infofreak", "postedDate": "27 April 2003", "reviewContent": "Cult director Jean-Pierre Melville was originally involved with French art legend Jean Cocteau, but really found his niche making hard boiled crime movies. 'Bob le flambeur' was the first major work by him, and he kept making movies up until the early 1970s with 'Dirty Money'. His work had a huge influence on the French New Wave led Godard and Truffaut (who cast him in a supporting role in 'Breathless' as an acknowledgment), and has proved to be a major inspiration for American film makers like Scorsese, Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson whose debut 'Hard Eight' owes 'Bob le flambeur' quite a debt. 'Bob..' really knocked me out, and along with the equally brilliant 'Rififi' directed by Jules Dassin and released the same year, it's one of THE great crime movies of the 1950s, and should be mentioned in the same breath as Huston's 'The Asphalt Jungle' and Kubrick's 'The Killing'. All four films have had an enormous influence on most subsequent movies in the heist genre. 'Bob's plot is quite simple but the story itself isn't the half of it. What Melville DOESN'T say is just as important as what he does, and the viewer has to piece a lot of it together for himself. Roger Duchesne is super cool as Bob, the ageing gambler on a perpetual bad streak, Daniel Cauchy is excellent as his cocky young protege Paolo, and Isabelle Corey is sexy and intriguing as Anne, the jailbait who gets involved with them both. Personally I prefer this movie and 'Rififi' to 'Breathless' and any French New Wave I've seen to date, but that says as much about my taste as much as the movies themselves. Even so I highly recommend 'Bob le flambeur' to anybody who involves crime movies. It's a classic of the genre, and still fantastically entertaining.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

First or not, French New Wave or not, \"Bob le Flambeur\" is one of the coolest and memorable films I've seen. The most fascinating element of this exquisite crime/dram/noir film is its title character, Bob Montagne- Bob the Gambler (Roger Duchesne). All women wanted to be with him and all young men wanted to be him. He was the man well respected and liked by the cops, the criminals, and the gamblers alike - the king of cool, the elegant loser with his own respectable code of honor. He drove an American car and wore an American hat but he belonged to the streets of Montmartre, Paris, where he was born just as the film itself that could've been only made by a French director who admired American films and had created a perfect blend of American gangster film and French sophisticated comedy of manners. Made back in 1955, the movie is fresh, crisp, sensual, modern and simply delightful. Having watched already all \"Ocean's\" movies, including Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack's classic, I see where the inspiration for them came from. \"Bob Le Falmbeur\" was released in the USA in 1982, nine years after Melville's death and became an instant cult hit. Often, cult movies are not the best made but it is not true in the case of \"Bob le Flambeur\". Its direction is perfect: seemingly simple and truly elegant, its cinematography is beautiful, its music score is amazing and its characters are not the caricatures - they are the real human beings of flesh and blood and they have something (or a lot) to lose. Acting is great by everyone with Roger Duchesne unforgettable and Isabelle Corey as a young streetwalker Anne whom Bob took under his wing, absolutely marvelous in her first role - child-like innocent yet already perfectly aware of her powers over the men, by the words of Bob's friend, \"she will go far -she knows what she wants but does not show it\".", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

We both loved all the crazy escapades that Paddington got into and he did it all with a good heart.I very much enjoyed seeing the first Paddington but did feel it wasn't quite Paddington with the scary woman and the scary scenes.Paddington 2 completely captures the essence of the the books and really wrings out the most of some of the characters.Brendan Gleeson is superb as the 'nasty' Knuckles who quickly warms to Paddington. This might sound far-fetched but the whole film is very childish. Now that's not childish in the sense of \"silly and immature\" but in the other definition of \"appropriate to a child\". The whole film shows and plays scenes as a child might imagine things to be - for example how the prison works and especially the lovely idea that the warden reads the inmates a bedtime story to help them all get to sleep.There are superb performance from all the actors and a huge number of cameos. Even the small scenes put in by the like of Joanna Lumley and Rob Brydon are clearly done with great love from the actors. Hugh Grant puts in a superb over the top performance as the baddie, which really let him flex his vocal talents!The whole film is done in bright colours and with a superb musical backing track. When you are watching the film be careful to pay attention to all the small details, such as the newspaper headlines and the To Do list in the Brown's Kitchen, there a huge number of little jokes in the background and I suspect I'll spot a whole load more when I watch this again on Blu-Ray!Not really spoilers but there is only one really 'scary' scene near the end but it is so beautifully done and you know that Paddington will win so even the little ones won't cry. And make sure you stay for ALL the credits as they play out to an amazing \"what happened after\" montage.I have noticed that that at the time of writing this review there were 927 votes and 15 people have given the film a 1-star. Now I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but in this case I suspect these people might not really understand Paddington and what he's all about, if you have young children and they love Paddington then they will love this film.This film is suitable for young children aged 4 to 104 :)Let you into a secret, when my wife and I went to watch this film there were a lot of people in the cinema but not one was under 18! From the looks of it the audience was aged 20 - 80!I cried and I laughed through the whole film and rekindled my inner Paddington.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

By building on an ingenious crime element and real plotting it has turned from a sentimental journey to something more. As an avid reader of the books as a child, the main worry is the spirit of the bear who believes in the good in everyone, while creating untold chaos around him, will get lost to serve the storyline or some idea of updating Paddington. Luckily, none of the spirit is lost, and instead, we have an immensely enjoyable, fun, funny, and charming film. The whole family loved it - and we all laughed, cried, and cheered.

{"imdbId": "tt4468740", "movieTitle": "Paddington 2", "title": "One of the year's biggest delights", "author": "TheLittleSongbird", "postedDate": "10 November 2017", "reviewContent": "Loved the first 'Paddington', was not sure whether that would be the case but it turned out to be one of that year's biggest surprises and delights. Was enthused about hearing that there was a sequel with the same crew returning, always a plus when it comes to sequels, but there was the concern as to whether it would fall victim to \"sequel-titis\".Very luckily, 'Paddington 2' does not fall victim to that. It is one of not many sequels to actually be equal in quality to its predecessor and come close to being even better. It maintains all of 'Paddington's' heart, fun and charm, maintaining everything that made that film so good, and even builds on that appeal. For such a hit-and-miss year and seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart, 'Paddington 2' was a much needed refreshment. Not saying at all that it has been a completely bad year, actually there have been very good to great films, just that 'Paddington 2' stood out in the best of ways in recent weeks.Maybe it could have been ever so slightly longer and would have again liked to have seen more of Mr Curry and his acrimonious relationship with Paddington. Everything else is magic.'Paddington 2' once again looks great. It's beautifully shot and vibrant in design with a little bit of grit and Paddington as to be expected couldn't have looked more perfect. The music score is suitably soothing, rousing and whimsical, while the direction keeps things moving at a bright and breezy pace. A pace that never slows down but doesn't ever feel too hasty either.Scripting is also spot on. The comedic moments are incredibly funny, the best of it hilarious, with rapid-fire wit, endearing quirkiness, clever gags that don't feel like pale retreads of before and perfectly pitched misunderstandings and physical comedy. Underneath all the humour and the darker and more suspenseful mystery/action-oriented elements of the story is a big heart and strong emotional core, with some lovely inspiring messaging and values that are very much current and some touching parts. It's also incredibly intelligent, not many films this year have treated its audience with the amount of respect that 'Paddington 2' has, and has such an endearing innocence.A large part of that is the character of Paddington himself. Can't fault his design or Ben Whishaw's beautiful voice acting, nor can one fault his truly adorable personality, absolutely love how he tries to still remain even in the grimmest of situations and he is easy to root for and love throughout. The story may on the slight side structurally but has a lot going on, without being cluttered, that makes it very much eventful and to me there weren't any tonal issues.Every ounce of the heart, charm and fun seen in 'Paddington' is here and everybody gets a chance to shine, especially Mr Brown and Mrs Bird of Paddington's family. The new characters are great additions, with a superior villain and the character of the cook Knuckles being one of the film's nicest surprises. Only Mr Curry could have been done better.Performances across the board are great. Hugh Bonneville balances comedy and drama with ease, Sally Hawkins is compassionate and Julie Walters is a hoot. Jim Broadbent is always a welcome presence and the younger actors are appealing. Brendan Gleeson excels in a departure role, a dramatic actor in a more comedic role in a family-friendly film could have gone wrong but Gleeson brings a curmudgeonly charm and great comic timing. Hugh Grant is also cast against type and brilliantly sends up himself and the world of acting. This is Paddington's film though.Overall, an absolute delight and refreshing. 9/10 Bethany Cox", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Firstly it is as funny and witty and as brilliantly animated as the first film. The excellent cast from the first film is also enhanced by a superb turn from Hugh Grant, who hasn't been as good as he is here in a long time. In fact it is quite clear to the viewer that Grant is thoroughly enjoying himself by playing against type and sending himself up as a faded egotistical actor and total cad who sets Paddington up to be the fall guy (or should that be Bear?) for a dastardly deed. There is a touch of the pantomime villain to his performance, but it works splendidly and it fits his character perfectly.All the wit and heart of the first film is still evident here and in some ways, built upon. Brendan Gleeson is also excellent as an old lag and prison cook who loses his angry nature when he succumbs to Paddington's charms and talents in the kitchen. There are also loads of great jokes too, some pitched at younger children and some deliberately aimed at the more adult viewer.All in all this is a worthy sequel and a great memorial to Paddingtons creator, Michael Bond, who died whilst this sequel was still being filmed. It is full of laughs, thrills, action sequences, great characters, some wonderful animation (one scene is an obvious nod to the 2D paper cut-outs of the human characters in the 1970s children's TV show) and you would have to have a hard heart indeed to not burst into tears at the wonderful ending. Also, don't leave the film until you watch Hugh Grant gloriously send himself up with a musical song and dance act as the end credits roll. Thoroughly recommended to anybody who wants to see 100 minutes of family friendly fun that isn't either sickly sweet or too dark for youngsters and still thoroughly watchable to adults too.

You know that I'm not a prude about action films: \"Die Hard\" is one of my all time favourites and I even gave this actor/director combo's previous outing - \"Non-Stop\" - a rather generous three Fads. But like many of my commutes, this is a hundred minutes of life that I won't get back again.Liam Neeson (\"A Monster Calls\", \"Taken 3\") plays Michael MacCauley an insurance salesman (no, I'm not making it up) who of course used to be a police officer with a certain set of skills. With advancing years, a couple of mortgages to keep up and a son about to go to college, he is financially rather exposed.When a bad day turns worse, the commuting MacCauley is approached by a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga, \"The Judge\", \"Up In The Air\") who offers him a financial bail-out for doing \"just one small thing\". No, it's not for sex in the toilet... it's to use his familiarity with the train and its normal passengers to find the person that 'doesn't fit there'. For there is a lot at stake and MacCauley is drawn into a perilous game where his own life and the lives of his son and wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern, \"Downton Abbey\") are put at risk. What the inexperienced writers (Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle (\"Non-stop\")) were clearly shooting for was a Hitchcockian \"ordinary man in deep-water\" style flick of the James Stewart \"North by Northwest\" variety.... but they really miss this by a mile. With the 65 year old Liam Neeson - here playing 60 - performing acrobatics on, under and across an express train, belief is not just suspended - it is hung drawn and quartered! The action is just ludicrously unrealistic. The plot also has more holes than a moth-eaten jumper. Omnipotence of the villains is evident, but never explained, and while they are fiendishly clever in some aspects they are face-palmingly stupid about others. (No spoilers, but the threat to MacCauley's family is mind-numbingly foilable).A 'major event' at the end of reel two (if you've seen the spoilerish trailer you'll know what this is) leads - notably without any 'consequence' - into a completely ridiculous final reel that beggars belief. It also includes a \"twist\" so obvious that the writers must have assumed an IQ of sub-50.This is a film that melds \"Taken\", \"Non-stop\", \"Unstoppable\", \"Strangers on a Train\" and - most bizarrely and cringe-worthily - \"Spartacus\" to create a cinematic mess of supreme proportions.

No.There was so much potential in this movie that was squandered. Henson shines in almost everything she's been in, and Billy Brown (as Tom) has held his own on How to Get Away with Murder. The plot isn't the worst either. Yet, what came out was a mediocre movie.The first issue we noticed was the weird scene changes both literally and tonally. At times, a transition would come in the middle of a scene, out of nowhere, in an extremely obvious, and not at all sophisticated fashion (think the screen-wipe transition you can use on PowerPoint). Tonally, all scenes would start out fairly mundane, jump immediately to something that was meant to be profound and thought-provoking, and then fall right back to a casual exchange in less than five minutes. It was awkward and left a bad taste in the mouth. Moviegoers are lucky that the movie is only 88 minutes long.The half-assed dialogue, the utter lack of character development and non-existent chemistry made it impossible to recover from these mistakes. Essentially, it seemed that this movie's main goal was to have a shootout scene set to \"Proud Mary.\"Big wheel keep on turnin' BAM BAM\nProud Mary keep on burnin' BAM BAM\nRollin', BAM BAM rollin', BAM BAM rollin' on the river BAM BAMIt would have been an effective short, because this scene was really awesome, save for the fact that members of a major crime family can't seem to land a single shot.In a world where people are hungry for more movies featuring POC and women in the lead, the filmmakers do a big disservice by making a subpar movie. Couple that with the complete lack of marketing budget this film seemed to have (perhaps because they had already sunk $14M into what they realized was a lackluster final product) and it's no wonder this film opened 8th behind a busy holiday release slate.Featuring: A movie set in Boston with ZERO Boston accents.

Even though most people know the origin story of Superman or Batman, the first movies start at the beginning because it makes sense; people want to see the backstories, the fictional town the protagonist lives in, their families and friends, etc.Condorito The Movie does not do this. Instead they opt for a Lord of The Rings-style opening, then the movie jumps to present time where Condorito and his friends, his nephew, his girlfriend Yayita and mother, and his archrival Pepe all know each other. Next thing you know, though, the narrative has moved into outer space.Why not show how Condorito met his friends, their adventures in sleepy Pelotillehue, and how he and Yayita met and became a couple? This last one is important because it has so much potential: she's respectable, attractive and fashionable, while Condorito is a happy-go-lucky guy with no ambition who lives in a shack. That would have been great! The comics don't provide their origins because each strip was an independent joke, but since this is a 90-minute movie the filmmakers could have set up a bona-fide franchise by starting at the beginning.\n \nThis is why this movie feels like a sequel; the creators made the choice to skip conventional storytelling and set an adventure in outer space. It does have its funny moments, I'll admit, but I keep thinking about what could have been.On another note, I think we should have all had the pleasure of watching this movie with the original Chilean voices. I don't know why they re-dubbed it with Mexican voice-actors for North America. I don't think Pixar is re-dubbing Coco with South American voices for that market.

{"imdbId": "tt4494382", "movieTitle": "Condorito: The Movie", "title": "Gotta be honest, it was better than I was expecting.", "author": "Rectangular_businessman", "postedDate": "20 November 2017", "reviewContent": "\"Condorito\" might not be very well-known in the United States, but it's a very iconic character in many Latin-American countries, being one of the most easily recognizable comic-book character from this side of the world.Considering that it's a very old comic, is not surprising that most of its humor could be seen as way too childish and simple for modern audiences (Some jokes occasionally include elements of adult humor and innuendo, though.) I enjoyed reading it during my childhood, and I still enjoy reading it from time to time even when the issues produced in the recent years had a severe decline in quality.With that being said, I only had very low expectations towards this movie: The first promotional images looked awful (I'm glad that those early versions of the main characters were changed for the actual movie, since the original CGI versions of Condorito and Con\u00e9 were both Uncanny Valley nightmares.) and the teaser trailers looked forgettable at best. However, when I finally decided to give it a chance, this animation turned out to be an acceptable adaptation of its source material. The plot it's a bit too childish and the CGI was quite average, but there were more than one scene where it managed to make me chuckle in the same way the comic does.As it was expected, a couple of elements from the original comic (like some jokes that would be considered inappropriate or politically incorrect for modern audiences) are toned down here, and like in many other animated films from the recent years, there were a couple of obligatory sappy sentimental moments, but the overall result was still adequate.In my opinion, the most negative aspect from the movie was the voice of the main character, which felt a little bit awkward in more than one scene and didn't fit his personality. It was a minor detail, but I can understand why it would bother some viewers.Another negative aspect is that the movie only focuses in a reduced number of characters from the original comic (The most easily recognizable ones) in order to give more screen-time to the new characters. I guess this detail could be forgiven for the sake of narrative, but at least some cameos of some secondary characters would have been nice (Of all those secondary characters, only one of them appears in a non-speaking role) Despite that, I still appreciate the overall result. Adapting a character like Condorito to big screen in a way it appeals to modern audiences while keeping its very particular identity wasn't an easy task (And let's be honest here: This movie could have been way worse) but it managed to be an OK flick for kids. I guess for those viewers who never read the original comics or those viewers who are aware of the existence of the comics but simply don't care about this, this might be just another generic CGI movie with very little to offer. But for those viewers who grew up reading Condorito comic, this might be at least a somewhat interesting watch.And for all its flaws, I definitely enjoyed this far more than the atrocious \"Boss Baby\" mess from Dreamworks.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt0368226", "movieTitle": "The Room", "title": "It's like sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode", "author": "Brickyard Jimmy", "postedDate": "12 January 2004", "reviewContent": "I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, 'The Room'  three times. With each viewing, 'The Room' becomes more complexly  entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where  The Room ends and I begin.  It is, without question, the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging.  Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the  greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark.  Simply put, 'The Room' will change your life.  It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the  bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that  you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no,  there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only  be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest  filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully  creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with  all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be  considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment  in The Room.  The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself.  Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him  it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a  Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of  Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these  things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed  inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will  fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the  first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth  style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly  fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out  of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been  anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.  The Room begins with 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly  evil fianc\u00e9e 'Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored  eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some  light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the  absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor  who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny,  who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends,  says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, 'I like to  watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse  ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very  special movie.  After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first  time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which  Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly  depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we  discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with  Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him.  Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian  sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be  to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and  electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in  the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg  Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store  mannequin, was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy  Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid  his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their  uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that  she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely  devoted fianc\u00e9, Johnny.  Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces  that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again.  But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of  the fact that she, according to her mother, \"cannot survive on her own  in the cutthroat 'computer business'\". But not before they recycle the  sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye  view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a  drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual  cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells  everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.  A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then  apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to  catch a football thrown by Mark.  All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic  moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the  line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as  you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time.  And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that  has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who  utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The  Room,  'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'  The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel.  See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid  that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can  recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The  Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching  the gospel according to Johnny.  My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day, 7  days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream  as well.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

You see, I was fortunate enough to have worked on the film. As I read the reviews here, especially the last one, which I am sure was written by our amazing Director/Actor/Producer/Writer, I felt I had to respond. Having the dubious honor of saying I worked on this film, has also brought with it the responsibility of telling the truth about what happened on set. Apparently Tommy had a lot of money sitting around and decided he needed to make a film. Not being able to decide what to shoot, film or video, we shot both. Side by side. Both cameras on the same head, being operated by one camera operator. We shot almost the whole thing in the parking lot and back storage shed (read- sound stage) of a camera rental house in Hollywood. I got the call to work on the show after they had already tried to start with another crew that ended up all being dismissed. I believe that we ended up being crew 2 of 4. The show never had much organization to it from the start. We were told it would be a 3 week shoot. At the end of 3 weeks we were exactly 1/2 way done. Crew calls were usually 8 a.m. tommy would show up around 10:30 or 11. Because he would take the HD video camera home with him every night, we had no choice but to wait for him. Since we were only in one room or outside the door in the parking lot, we did not have anything to do but sit around and wait every day. When Tommy arrived we would have to see if he was in actor mode or director mode. If he was in actor mode, you were not allowed to talk to him so he could \"stay in character.\" Since he was in almost every scene, he was always in his \"actor\" mode. This also meant that he could not direct. Noting the huge delays every day and the fact that we were never seeming to get anything done, our wonderful script supervisor stepped up and became the director...at least he tried. One day he had to go off and do another show and asked if anyone else wanted to step up and direct and keep some script notes. When nobody volunteered, I stepped up. I loved it. It was my directorial genius that had tommy bump into Lisa as they were taking the bad guy off the roof! I will also take credit for the now famous line \"You are tearing me apart, Lisa!\" In the first 10 takes, tommy kept saying \"You are TAKING me apart!\" As the crew tried to keep it together, I felt I should right the situation and corrected the line. The crew was also instrumental in keeping the chicken line in. \"CHEEEEEPPPPPPP, CHEEP, CHEEP, CHEEP, CHEEP!\" We begged our scripty/director to keep him doing it take after take. Though the crew ultimately followed the original DP out the door and quit, we are all proud to have taken part in the making of this film. Amongst the film crew realms, we are minor celebrities. \"Dude, you worked on that thing?\" is a phrase that is often heard when The Room is mentioned.I have the pleasure of driving through Hollywood every day and still seei ng the billboard for the film up and Tommy glaring at me as if to say, \"I telled you I could make movie.\" For those looking for a photo op, it's on Highland, a few blocks south of Sunset. I know that tommy took out an ad in the trade papers asking \"For Your Consideration\", I only wished that I could see him on stage accepting an Academy Award. It would be well earned. Rumor has it that he has a vampire film in the works... let's hope so... I only hope I get the opportunity to work on it. I can only hope that The Room becomes a cult classic with midnight showings. I'll put my tux on and bring a football. Perhaps I'll stand up for a Q&A afterward and tell the stories I have so fondly tried to burn from my memory. My other dream is for the DVD. There are 100's of hours of behind the scenes footage out there. The camera for the behind the scenes material was always recording. ALWAYS! It will be awesome to see what took place on our set.

Unintentionally inept characters engage in progressively bizarre and unnatural interactions which seem to peak at erratic and unexpected intervals. The awkwardness of the actors is framed by strange pauses, jarring scripts and incredibly bizarre production techniques - there are ample 'deer in the headlights' moments, in which you can feel genuine sympathy for these people who are obviously so caught up in Tommy's strange and dominating creative control that they've failed to see any better.Other filmmakers play with similarly surreal concepts - David Lynch for example - but this film lacks anything resembling artistic refinement, insight or self awareness placing it far from comparison. It's kind of like watching a train crash in slow motion - random, incoherent, disastrous, accidental and ultimately painful. The sense of alienation emanating from this film places the audience extremely far from being able to relate to what's happening on screen, which leaves a lot of room for uncontrollable laughter given the right circumstances.The camera work and production techniques would not be out of place in many daytime soap operas, nor would the script and plot, but there is an undefinable quality which separates this movie from the sense mediocrity often found in such shows and instead casts it deep into the abyss of tragically bad film making where it will be forever trapped along with Wiseau's artistic integrity.

The 3 brothers Hause, Ashmore and Holmes did a decent job, so did Willis, when he were on screen, which he barely were. Also \"hecnhman\" no. 1, played by Brosnan also did a good job.\nBiggest gripes I had with the movie:1: A few big ones for me, were that supposedly two of the brothers are well trained marines. Yet they don't foresee that their identity might be compromised as they go full rambo on a druglord. Just casually leaving the wife at home as if it were any regular day. She should have been sent to some remote cabin, paid in cash. 2: Also why would you assault the druglords major operation headquarter, without much in sense of tactical entry and tactics. They just walse right in, and with a policeshield for only cover. They hit the druglord, rescue the hostages and leave. Never even checking to make sure he is down for the count and no double-tap. You could see the revenge hit, he would soon make on them, coming from a mile off.3: And why would you (a), use you own truck, without atleast hiding its numberplate and (b), why would you return to your everyday address between skirmishes and also plan meetings there.4: And during the last fight at the house, as the one brother gets shot. The 3rd brother (untrained), but still. He just rushes out infront of a weapon he clearly know is there, because he just saw his brother get shot. He however, decides to turn his back to the gun, so he can cry over his brothers dead body. And for some reason the \"badguy\" with the weapon, should have killed the 3rd brother long ago, but figures he wants to do it excecution-style, which is tempting, I guess. Now that he is kneeling down, facing away... but still.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Their motivations seem to be to do whatever might make a visually interesting scene. It's largely contrived and predictable. The movie is a sequence of scenes we've seen before, but executed without panache and little logic. It's part teenage fantasy fulfillment for middle-aged gun nuts, part DTV low-budget actioner, part morality play with the subtlety of an Aesop fable. The actors do as well as they can with the material provided, but the script seems something that even Steven Segal would reject for one of his recent Eastern European productions. Production values aren't too terribly bad, but suffer from over-reliance on jiggly-cam shots. With some fifty-thousand screenplays written each year and a huge catalogue of scripts that haven't been produced, one would think they could have found better material.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt1413492", "movieTitle": "12 Strong", "title": "2 Long", "author": "john robinson (Fizzle_Talks)", "postedDate": "28 January 2018", "reviewContent": "This is probably the worst war biopic I've ever seen, excluding thoroughly fictionalized ones such as Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. In fact, I would hesitate to even call Bay's more recent war film, 13 Hours, a bad film as it at least had a compelling story and fully realized characters that I cared about in spite of it's many shortcomings.This film is cheesier than the average 80's action flick. Every line of dialogue feels like it came off a script, and not a very clever one at that. It feels like there are dozens of lines in the film from every major character that are delivered with the desperate intention to become quotes.The main character especially comes off as unreasonably brash. During the introduction, he immediately gives his superiors attitude following the September 11th attacks, and subsequently throws a tantrum, kicking over his desk to protest against his promotion, and immediately gets what he wants for being an impatient manchild, though the movie intended me to get the impression that this guy's valiant and brave. Despite no combat experience, he's confident that he and his team are coming back alive after kicking some terrorist asses, and they're gonna look dope doin' it.At no point did I feel any tension. Unlike just about every other film of the genre, the soldiers aren't shown as having fear despite lazily uttered lines claiming they do. Characters charge into battle constantly, like birds with their chests puffed up, to such a blatant degree that it's surprising that they weren't going to subvert this trope and found it simply acceptable. There's hardly any struggle for victory in this film, as it feels the good guys are chasing the baddies down like dogs and bombarding them from a distance with air strikes over and over. It's like 300, except with modern weaponry, and less tact, and no style. The American soldiers feel invincible, and they pretty much are as they survive several close-proximity explosions while baddies are turned to red mist, hoist by their own petards. There's no attempt made to surprise viewers, and oddly enough it tries its best to be comfortable and digestible. Though it can be argued that too many films nowadays are dark and gritty, there's a place for that tone, and war films are definitely the place to stick to that. The best war films are the ones that tend to delve deep into the horrors of war, but this film would rather be a positive idea rather than a though-provoking experience. It is easy to evoke strong sympathy for characters of a war film, especially when they're based on true events, but this film misses the mark entirely.The story isn't all that interesting to begin with. There's good intentions here, which are likely more apparent in the novel they skimmed through in making this adaptation, but ultimately it comes off as the less interesting spin-off in the events surrounding 9/11 and the war in the Middle East. United 93 has an incredible narrative, and it manages to make the most of its incredibly compelling story of real-world heroism while remaining respectful and realistic. 13 Hours, while very flawed, tells the politically controversial story of the Benghazi attacks on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. Zero Dark Thirty tells the story of assassinating Osama Bin Laden and is critically acclaimed. This film feels kind of like Pearl Harbor if that movie skipped the part where Pearl Harbor was attacked and instead focused on Hiroshima.The editing is sloppy at best. There are many instances of blood squibs that look very digital which cheapen the movie and make it look like a video game at parts. Numerous smoke, fire, and explosion effects also looked quite fake, and resolutions of objects seemed inconsistent. Sometimes objects and backgrounds looked blown up and low-detail or even skewed vertically in contrast to the foreground characters, leading me to believe they must have been chroma-keyed in, poorly. There are annoyingly useless and repetitive clips, such as the needless cuts to the Jafar-esque villain of the film giving menacing stares at our heroes, which add nothing to the plot or characters and just act as padding in an already paper-thin story for an extremely bloated movie.Also, this may be an error on my theater's part, but the audio was out of sync. Characters' lips were moving about a quarter of a second behind the actual audio, though it wouldn't be unlikely that something went wrong beyond the filmmaking itself, so I won't hold this against the film as of yet.The humor was cringeworthy at best. There's jokes and gags tossed in here and there which are thankfully not too frequent, but while they're intended for levity they come off as immature and inappropriate, especially given this movie's not depressing and thus doesn't require any levity. One character says he's hungry despite there being no word of this and nothing to hint to anyone in the crew being famished at this point, and he ends up buying a sheep off a local for $300, just to execute a punchline that this guy should be working for military commission, and instead of getting a scene with the crew eating a sheep and allowing for character interaction we skip to more boring military discussion followed by one of the longest action sequences I've ever seen in a movie.This movie lacks any passion and is simply a paint-by-numbers war flick with no more intention than cashing in on the lowest common denominators, and it will impress none other than the least demanding moviegoers.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

If you do so, you'll be obviously disappointed. Otherwise, it's a completely entertaining and fun ride through some surprisingly complex characters and an unexpectedly intricate game of cat and mouse.There have been some comparisons of this movie to the movie Heat, and I think they may be somewhat warranted. OBVIOUSLY, this does not hold the gravitas of a mid-90's DeNiro/Pacino face-off, but plot structure, pacing, character development and the Los Angeles backdrop were all very familiar. At the core, you have Pablo Schreiber, who is 1 or 2 decent movies away from being given a real shot at a career defining role. He led this film effortlessly and truly gives you a very raw sense of character. Gerard Butler plays Gerard Butler and convincingly so. The two square off for 140 minutes and it's surely fun to watch.The 140 minute runtime seems to have garnered some attention from reviewers. Yeah, it's long, but it really doesn't feel that way. The pace of the film is stellar, and you never really feel any \"look down at your phone\" moments. The heist movie is often times full of overdone clich\u00e9s and unconvincing \"suspense\" but for some reason this film was able to put a fresh twist on everything you see. If you've seen a trailer for the film, you'll be very happy with it. I think this is a case of extremely good marketing and a trailer can make or break your audience's expectations for a film. From the trailer, you see a crew of goons led by some wannabe badass and a crew of cops trying to intimidate them and take them down. The trailer doesn't give you much of a glimpse at anything more than elementary storyline, which is why if you see this film, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Like to the point where they have to show other bad guys tattoos to prove that they are tougher. The motel scene looks like a 15 year old's dream of how tough guys act. Sitting around with scantly clad women, just drinking, smoking and punching things.I can't really figure out where the director was going with the two teams of people. They were both \"bad guys\" where they had the cops being shown doing criminal activity and then the bad guys were shown in a more humane light. This just creates 2 sides of a coin that you don't care which one it lands on. It wasn't the edgy \"this is real life and everyone is terrible\". It was meeting a quota for We are shown a bit of how Butler's job gets in the way of his family life but not in any meaningful way. He isn't remorseful, honest (which there is no down side to being honest like in most movies) and most importantly he isn't even likable. A character with no redeeming qualities.50 cent is a rapper turned actor and unlike any other person who followed that career path for these roles has made no effort to improve. I can't hate on him though as the roles he picks are minimal at best and can't say his character took away anything from the movie. He had maybe 1 line and then mumbled something at the end.The \"boss\" Pablo Schreiber was decent. Not in my top 30 bad guys. No hand to hand fight, no real outsmarting(the bank scene he literally won himself 45 seconds over butler that somehow turned in to an hour lead) and meh leadership. You get to see him shirtless in a few scenes and they like to lift weights, which is very important. Again it is tough to even grade these people because of the lack of dialogue. You will not be quoting him any time soon from this movie. Actually you won't be quoting anything from this movie.O'Shea Jackson Jr. actually showed some acting chops. I would say he was the most surprising actor in the movie. Nothing that will win an award but to shine in a turd of a movie is still something.The action was sparse and a bit lacking. Generic gun fights. The twist at the end was the only reason it should be 5 stars. Was a little predictable if you are as perceptive as a 5th grader but was still nice they at least did SOMETHING. But then it just ends on Butler's part. Nothing mentioned from this family, nothing on his next move (if any)...just a few dead guys and the twist.Overall I'd say wait for it to go to dvd and not waste your time with seeing it in the theaters.

To determine if this is your type of movie, you need only answer one question: Are you a Nicholas Sparks fan? Even though this is based on a novel by Heidi McLaughlin and not Nicholas Sparks, no normal person would be able to tell the difference, as the formula and story structure is very familiar (even the marketing campaign capitalizes on this). Perhaps that is the key to the success of movies like this - the stories are like a warm, comfy blanket to some folks.Picturesque (and fictional) St Augustine, Louisiana is the setting for the love story of Liam and Josie. Things get off to a rocky start as the jilted bride is stranded on her wedding day. The film jumps ahead 8 years and we find that Liam (Alex Roe, THE 5TH WAVE) is now a country music superstar with a drinking problem and a duct-taped flip phone, while Josie (Jessica Rothe, HAPPY DEATH DAY) is a successful business owner and single mom. It's at this point where you could most assuredly guess what happens next, as predictability and commitment to the formula are the mission.Bethany Ashton Wolf is the writer/director and her film benefits from the presence of star-in-the-making Alex Roe and the precocious Abby Ryder Fortson as Josie's daughter. Mr. Roe spends much of the movie in various stages of sweat (I guess that's supposed to be sexy?), but the camera loves him and he has a unique approach that sets him apart from the endless line of pretty boy actors. Young Miss Fortson has already played the daughter of ANT-MAN and she has the ability to come off as normal kid, rather than an actress playing a kid. John Benjamin Hickey (Liam's dad), Gillian Vigman (publicist), Tyler Riggs (Josie's brother), and Peter Cambor (Liam's agent) fill the supporting roles, and it's Travis Tritt who adds an all-too-brief touch of authenticity to the music and local saloon.

{"imdbId": "tt7215444", "movieTitle": "The Final year", "title": "The Obama Administration's Blindspot", "author": "www.ramascreen.com", "postedDate": "13 January 2018", "reviewContent": "Director Greg Baker's documentary, \"The Final Year\" gives you a moving and intimate look at an administration doing everything it can before the clock runs out. It's a window into the inner workings of the white house back when the adults run the place. And for those of who dislike Donald Trump's presidency with a passion, this documentary definitely will make you wish that President Barack Obama had still been the one leading the country. But this documentary also makes you feel sad, not because \"O, I miss the Obama administration,\" but more about \"where did it all go wrong that we now have Trump's administration\"What Greg Baker focuses on in this documentary is very simple, it focuses on president Barack Obama's foreign policy team, specifically U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Powers, deputy adviser Ben Rhodes and secretary of state John Kerry, during their last year in office, before they leave power after eight years. First of all it's impressive how much access Greg Baker and his team were allowed to have, I bet other press or other filmmakers at the time were probably envious of the exclusivity that Greg's team got to enjoy, they even were allowed to document the staff's personal moments with their loved ones and family members. Clearly it's all done in a very good light, nothing that would appear like trouble in paradise, but if the goal was to show that these powerful influential people at the core of it are just humans like you and me with their own typical family situations despite their big jobs, then that's exactly what you'll get to see here in The Final Year.Another thing that this documentary gives us a view of is an understanding of how complex and complicated these jobs are. To the point where you might watch this docu and start thinking, man they are spreading themselves way too thin. Secretary of State John Kerry has to juggle between Syria issues and Iran issues, and then Samantha Power has to travel around the world to even the most remote places and then somehow find time to give a speech at a U.S. citizenship event, the same goes with Ben Rhodes who's consistently busy trying to come up with the right speeches, the right wording for president Obama. Watching them do what they do, I wonder how much red bull or caffeine intake do they have on a daily basis to keep themselves on because they're juggling so much. You mights say, but Rama, that is their job description but an argument can also be made that this is the burden that comes with the whole world looking to us for leadership. Every country is is depending on us to broker a deal or to rescue them, so much so that you wonder if it all might backfire if everything has to always depend on the United States being the deciding factor. So keep in mind that this documentary is mostly about Obama's foreign policies, not his domestic ones. This is a look at Obama not as the commander in chief necessarily but more as the leader of the free world and the burdens that come with that.Which leads me to my last point,,.. because this documentary shows us Obama administration's final year, hence the title, the documentary also shows the nervousness that the staff, specifically Ben Rhodes was feeling as it was nearing the election, he really wanted Hilllary to win and he told himself that but you can tell, he was also worried at the prospect of Trump winning instead. So when that did happen, it hit them like a brick wall because their expectations for Hillary Clinton's victory was so high, that when otherwise was the result, their disappointment is tremendous. It's like when you get your hopes up, super excited because you're super confident that your team would win but then they lose, because you were in such a high, the disappointment is devastating for you. That's what happened here.And so, while this docu shows us how diligent the words of Ben Rhodes, Samantha Power and John Kerry are, the facts on the ground remains and that is the Democratic party lost about 1,000 seats under Obama, and the Rust Belt electoral voters even those who previously voted for Obama, ended up voting for Trump instead of Hillary. So perhaps either the Obama administration was too focused on their policies, as this documentary shows, or they were stuck in their bubble so much so that they were not aware of the suffering and the struggles of middle America. Which is why I said earlier that this documentary is somewhat saddening because here you have a bunch of great people doing great work, like the Iran deal and others but the voters at home would rather roll the dice and gamble on a fake populist. So that should say something about the Obama administration. You can argue, but Rama you can only do so much in 8 years, you can't please everybody,.. be that as it may, just like actions have consequences, inaction or lack of action has its consequences too. Ben Rhodes says in this documentary after Trump just won, in order to keep himself from feeling hopeless, he said that the pendulum will come back, pendulums swing this way and comes back to center again. That's nice and all but it's also an irresponsible comment, because while the pendulum swings this direction, it's us the regular folks who have to suffer through all the disastrous policies that Trump's administration applies, some of the damages may be irreparable. The pendulum illustration is only comforting for those who don't live paycheck to paycheck and are economically fine. So to conclude, if you're wondering if The Final Year has some sort of an agenda, or perhaps director Greg Baker just point and shoot the camera and whatever happens happens, The Final Year is both an excellent showcase of wisdom, compassionate but firm leadership but also a cautionary tale that if you're taking on too much, some things may get neglected. What can you accomplish when you're literally racing against the clock, when your decisions affect other people's lives? If there's anything that can be taken away from this is that there should be a balancing act on the part of any administration, a positive, healthy, and prosperous balancing act.-- Rama's Screen --", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt6336356", "movieTitle": "Mary and the Witch's Flower", "title": "Not perfect, but gorgeous, enjoyable and delightful nonetheless", "author": "themadmovieman", "postedDate": "8 July 2017", "reviewContent": "This is such a nice film. With a fun and imaginative story surrounding pleasant characters, all set to the backdrop of yet more incredibly beautiful animation, Mary And The Witch's Flower is the perfect film to get you smiling within an hour and a half. It's not perfect, occasionally struggling with pacing issues and a lack of character depth, but on the whole, it's a wonderfully enjoyable and uplifting watch from start to finish.What's most important to note about this film is that it's not a Ghibli movie. Although directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who made Arrietty and When Marnie Was There, as well as bearing huge resemblances to Ghibli in animation style and genre, there are some key differences that set it apart from just being another Studio Ghibli movie.Above all, the type of story that we see unfold in this film differs somewhat from what we've been used to from Studio Ghibli. While Ghibli dealt more often than not used fantasy stories to deal with some very deep themes and create intimate and engrossing watches, Studio Ponoc, the company that makes this film, has gone for something a lot more pure and family-friendly, in a similar vein to the likes of My Neighbour Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service. In that, it's a little more similar to Disney's storytelling style, although thanks to the beautiful animation here, Ponoc stands out well as its own.And if there's one thing that is so brilliant about Mary And The Witch's Flower, it's undoubtedly the animation. Not only does it bring back the mad and imaginative worlds that Studio Ghibli have transported us to so vividly before, but it shows another step in this style of anime that adds significantly to the visual beauty throughout. So, while we still have the gorgeous hand-painted scenery backdrops portraying the lush English countryside, there are some scenes that venture closer towards the photo-realistic style of animation that many other anime films have taken on board in recent years, yet has never been a choice of Studio Ghibli's.As a result, you get the warm and delightful feel of a Studio Ghibli movie, but there's still even more eye-popping visuals throughout to make it seem all the more impressive, and with its fantastically colourful palette that brings the fantastic world to life, it's a vivid and visually gorgeous watch from start to finish.Moving on from the visuals, Mary And The Witch's Flower also succeeds in delivering a properly entertaining story from start to finish. It's not a repeat of Kiki's Delivery Service as some have suggested, but rather based on a famous English story called The Little Broomstick, and it's a hugely enjoyable watch throughout.There are times when the wizarding world it dives into strays a little too far into Harry Potter territory, occasionally getting a little bogged down in magic jargon, but on the whole, it's a story about a young girl finding her confidence in the most extraordinary of ways, and given that we have such a likable protagonist in young Mary, it's a delight to follow her along on this magical journey of a lifetime.In general, the film works really well to give you a fun and pleasant watch from start to finish, although it's not completely perfect, given that it really struggles to build a beautifully calm and intimate opening act with something a little more Disney in the middle and early third portion, frustrated by a jarring change in pace on a couple of occasions.With all that said, however, I had a wonderful time with Mary And The Witch's Flower. It's a visually beautiful movie that you'll be marvelling at from start to finish, thanks to the incredible animation from Studio Ponoc that steps up Ghibli's legacy by another notch. Its fantastical and storybook-style atmosphere makes for a lovely watch throughout, featuring a delightful protagonist and various mystical worlds that will undoubtedly have you smiling right to the finish.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I'm a bit confused by the super-negative reviews of this film. I guess people were expecting a film on par with past Studio Ghibli movies? Lets be real here, as sad as it is, the age of Studio Ghibli is over, unless Hayao Miyazaki decides to return to the directors seat and make another full-length feature film. Which at this point seems unlikely. The fact that we have a studio like Ponoc to carry on the torch of 2D animated projects in the style of Gibli should be celebrated I think. I went into this movie not expecting it to be on par with any of Studio Ghibli's past works, yes it's no Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away. I did enjoy Mary and the Witch's Flower more so than Miyazaki's last two films, The Wind Rises and Ponyo. The only other Hiromasa Yonebayashi films I've seen was Arriety, never saw When Marine Was There. I do think this film is better than Arriety was.Mary and the Witches Flower looks like a Studio Ghibli film, the character animation is really great, the backgrounds, while reminiscent of past Ghibli works are nice, but not on the same level of detail, which was fine to me. The characters and the story is good, again, not as solid as past Ghibli works, but I enjoyed it overall. The biggest thing lacking to be was a musical score from Joe Hisaishi, but he has never done music for a Hiromasa Yonebayashi film. The last film he composed music for was The Princess Kaguya, which was a big deal. I'm getting off-track here, but the last I will say is that is if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli, and are yearning to see a full-length feature film in traditional 2D animation, go see this film if you are able to, just don't go in expecting it to be as good as one of the Studio Ghibli classics.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt6336356", "movieTitle": "Mary and the Witch's Flower", "title": "An Alright Introduction into Studio Ponoc", "author": "Will K", "postedDate": "24 January 2018", "reviewContent": "This debut film by the newly formed Studio Ponoc delivers most of the magic and excitement of films from Studio Ghibli, but the film has several shortcomings that are impossible to look away from.The central conflict of the film is not introduced until a good portion through the film. The films opening has lots of excitement and chaos, but once that brief five minutes is up, we are quickly shifted to a more mundane and uneventful first act. We're introduced to many characters in Mary's life who get little to no characterization, and are barely relevant. Mary is the only character who has a personality, so it's hard to connect with any of the other characters in the real world.The antagonists of the film come across as run of the mill bad guys, with no special motivations to set them apart in any way. They essentially operate as one unit, despite being two different characters. Their \"evil plan\" (for lack of a better term), doesn't hold much weight to it, and doesn't seem to really end up being a horrible threat.The story's first act concerns Mary and her everso boring life. And I mean boring! Nothing happens in the first act. It's hardly engaging, and the only real event is her finding the Witch's Flower. A good part of the second act is spent with Mary touring a magical college, which doesn't build up to anything. The final act has moments of intensity here and there, but the threat doesn't seem to be as imminent. This is likely due to the shallow characters not holding enough promise, or that the story was dragged out for so long, it became unenjoyable. Mary is also pitted against a task that has no real effect on her. The story isn't about her, and it isn't personal or emotionally effective. While her friend, Peter, is involved in the conflict, he is so unlikeable and bullies Mary in the first part of the film, so there is no reason to care about him!However, the film has beautiful scenery and animation. It's a spectacle to look out and has some of the most wonderful sound design and music. Being a debut film, the shortcomings are alright, but I hope the studio improves as time goes on.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt6336356", "movieTitle": "Mary and the Witch's Flower", "title": "The Spirit of Studio Ghibli Lives On In This Delightful Fantasy Adventure", "author": "nbfcblog", "postedDate": "29 January 2018", "reviewContent": "Based on the 1971 children's novel The Little Broomstick by Mary Stewart, this anime fantasy adventure is a satisfying debut from Studio Ponoc that manages to carry on the glorious legacy of Studio Ghibli.Founded back in 2015 by producer Yoshiaki Nishimura in the aftermath of Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya) and Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle) announcing retirement and Ghibli moving away from feature film animation; MATWF crew members consists of the director behind The Secret World of Arriety and the wonderful When Marnie Was There Hiromasa Yonebayashi along with several ex-Studio Ghibli animators.So if you saw the trailer and wondered to yourself \"This looks really Ghibli-ish?\", that is because MATWF is essentially another Studio Ghibli release in all but name.Everything that was great about Ghibli is still present from the colorful crisp animation, to the gorgeous spacious shots of countryside landscape, the magical castle serenely floating in the sky, it's well-developed and relatable young female protagonist and technology vs. environmentalism themes, although this time magic is used as a metaphorical substitute for technology.One criticism that could be leveled at this film is that it almost echoes Ghibli too much. Longtime fans will easily be able to spot elements from Kiki's Delivery Service (focus on magic and witchcrafts, Mary's black cat), Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle (Madame Mumblechook office) and Spirited Away along with other films such as Harry Potter (magic school setting) and even Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.Although given this is Ponoc's first movie and thus their initial flagship title (their logo consists of an image of the title character), I can understand why the filmmakers felt compelled to play things close to the chest this time. Hopefully for the their next set of feature films we will start to see more experimentation in the vein of Only Yesterday, My Neighbor the Yamata's, Whisper of the Heart, and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya.In the meantime, MATWF is a fantasy action adventure of the highest order that can be enjoyed by individuals of all ages.From the opening sequence alone portraying a young witch making a high-flying escape from an exploding castle in the sky while dodging shape-shifting henchman, the movie does a really good job of hooking the audience in with awe-inspiring spectacle and unique visuals. Admittedly the film does slow down a bit during the first twenty minutes when it's introducing Mary and her ordinary country-side living; but once she discovers her flying broom and is transported to Cloud City Hogwarts, it's a delightful adventure that features unique interpretations of old Ghibli themes.The pacing is gentle but brisk and there is a great sense of danger amidst the wonderment, which is further enhanced by some splendid comedy gags such as the mishaps pertaining to Mary's magic powers and a certain running joke involving a monkey.Takatsugu Muramatsu returns from Yonebayashi's previous film When Marnie was There to provide another fantastic melodic score. It complements the graceful visuals like bread on butter and has a great neoclassical European vibe with it's use of string instruments and flutes that perfectly goes along with the film's more adventure movie tone.It's certainly far from the level of Ghibli's masterpieces (Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away), I personally did wish for more world building and Peter, Mary's male companion, sadly goes under-developed with the \"sick mother\" plot point never having a payoff.However, as a longtime admire of the work done by Ghibli and it's crew, seeing this movie for it's one-night only showing at my local Marcus Cinema was a great experience, especially when seeing it in a theater packed with moviegoers both young and old.I look forward to what Studio Ponoc will release next!", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I did not have a chance to discuss with them the film at the end, one of the reasons being that some of them left before the end of the screening. I cannot be sure about the reasons, they may have seen the movie already, or they reserved the pleasure of full viewing for the festival, or maybe they just had the same feeling as I did. It's a crazy and fun idea, but not enough for a full and watchable movie.Maybe part of the explanation is that Christian Nicolson, the author of 'This Giant Papier-M\u00e2ch\u00e9 Boulder Is Actually Really Heavy' seems to be - according to the IMDb - a first-timer in everything: script writing, acting, film direction, producing movies. Nicholson may be aware of his lack of experience, so he tried to turn it into an advantage, even more than this, into a concept. Here is the story (no spoiler, it happens in the first five minutes). Three fans attend the screening of a movie at a sci-fi convention, and somehow find themselves trapped into the world of the low cost films of the genre. Not only their universe is blurred, but also their personalities, and they will need to fight to survive and get back. Luckily, this is the less credible alternate universe ever created in movies, as all effects and gadgets are more visible than in the first movies of Melies, and more ridiculous than in the worst King Kong film. Space ships are made of hair-drying fans, transporting devices of shower heads, etc.A good idea does not make a film, as original and as crazy it may be, and 'This Giant Papier-M\u00e2ch\u00e9 Boulder Is Actually Really Heavy' is a good illustration on this respect. What may have worked in the 1960s TV shows for kids that lasted 15 or 30 minutes at most cannot work for a 90 minutes film, if it is not complemented by well defined characters, fresh jokes, good acting. Unfortunately these are all but absent in this film, and after we understand the concept and have fun for a few minutes we start waiting in vain for something new and interesting to happen. None of these happen here, and the parody is reduced at its own parody with very little comic effect. By the end this comedy was closer to put me to sleep than make me laugh.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

In this case, we have what is like live-action cut scenes from a non-plot driven Russian Grand Theft Auto video game. There are no real rules in Russia on the roads by the look of it (perhaps the dash cams are to assist in that the cops make our corrupt cops look like boy/girl scouts). People get out of cars and into fights; sometimes a car just goes off road into a river for a river-car ride; a car just crashes head on into another and we hear the couple of people saying where they're broken; a guy gets on top of a woman's car as she us parked, and he acts like a mad primate as she drives and is hysterical (he may just be deaf); trucks crash and flip; cows get hit and go on their way; the word 'f**k' is used so often in 67 minutes I think this out-f***s the 3 hour Scorsese crime epics. The appeal in other words is to be a full witness to the insanity, and while these are taken from YouTube uploads, I think placing then in a short, to the point cinematic context is a nice radical act. It's found-footage when it comes down to it, and at the same time the tone is like taking all of the gnarly bits from Godard's apocalyptic Weekend and none if the political stuff. Human nature in Russia is brutal, unforgiving, and howlingly funny in these videos. At one point a car drives right on through a forest fire (!) that is happening on either side of the road on one hand, and on another a car chases a running bear and all the driver can think to say is to laugh at the bear's defecating. And is that a comet falling to Earth?In other words, The Road Movie may or may not appeal to you, and I wonder what rewatchability it will have - unlike the insanity of the Jackass films, as one more comparison, there aren't any personalities to latch on to as we are Rear Window-ing as the passengers if these literal car wrecks - but it's a total blast from start to finish and a unique piece of cinema in this decade.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It's short for a feature-length film and it has no narration or graphics (except for some words and numbers that appear on the screen), which makes this movie a documentary in the purest sense of the word. It documents. Period. Even more unusual is WHAT it documents - the strange things that happen on the roads of Russia and other former Soviet Republics. That's right, it's a movie made up of dashcam videos.But it's much more than just a series of spectacular vehicle crashes (even though there are plenty of those). These videos span 2011-2016 (based on the dates on the outer edges of the clips) and they let us see and hear shocking, humorous and bewildering things that happen in the car, to the car and outside of the car - and quite the variety it is - and almost all from the cars of ordinary, everyday people. Throughout the movie, there are the aforementioned crashes - and horrible driving conditions - from fire to ice and everything in between. From a couple different angles, we see a streak of light in the sky. (Is it a meteor? Is it a plane crash? Is it a UFO? We hear drivers and passengers discussing it, but they never find out. And neither do we.) There's a police chase through the streets of Moscow - with an unidentified vehicle heading straight for St. Peter's Square (one of the few sequences from police cars).And the videos include plenty of clips of people behaving oddly, comically and inexplicably: An apparently mentally ill person jumps on the hood of a car and starts screaming at the windshield. A barefoot young woman who is crying appears out of nowhere, sits on the hood of a car for a moment, and then walks over the top of it. A driver who is apparently upset at the driver with the dashcam comes after that driver with an axe - and then things really get serious. Another driver and his passenger negotiate terms with an unseen prostitute (audio only, but subtitled for non-Russian audiences).It's all shot from the (usually) stationary, but unflinching perspective of the dashcam (like when a thief grabs one of the cameras and runs off with it - with the owner in hot pursuit). \"The Road Movie\" is skillfully edited voyeuristic pleasure. It's often surprising, sometimes funny, occasionally frightening and always interesting. Like observing a car crash, police chase or another person even crazier than you, you just can't look away. This film allows us to indulge in some good old-fashioned rubber-necking, in many different situations and without the fear of getting into an accident ourselves or being judged by others - unless of course, they see you watching the movie, but then, they are too!

Unblended cinema magic! You could feel the passion and heart that was put into this throughout; the filming took more than 90 days (wich is abnormally long) but this care and eagerness to bring Pio's world to life in a pure and enthralling way is reflected upon every scene. An important reason for this was probably the characters who felt delightfully authentic, not infected by hollywoodian handsome faces but (apparently the director also used real people from the area) real human faces of wich you simply couldn't doubt there truth and were going straight into your heart. Another decisive factor in the film's relish was beyond a doubt the dynamic and beautiful camera work, capturing the streets of South-Italy and it's powerful faces in warm colours and shifting it's close focus across the action. At the same time A Ciambra shifts your own focus upon Pio's social reality, offering you an absorbing and enriching window upon this poor region in Italy in the spirit of Italian neorealism.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The story of Pio's (Pio Amato) coming of age in an impoverished Romani enclave is told with unremitting neo-realism and a point of view almost exclusively young 14 year-old Pio's. It's a companion piece to the director's Mediterranea and a sequel.Realism is what made Italian cinema its reputation as far back as Rossellini in the first half of the 20th century. This iteration dares to place the camera almost on Pio's shoulder to give the sense of everything Pio is seeing and if his decisions are good ones. It doesn't get more than this.That's the rub of this powerful, seemingly documentary capture of small-life in Calabria, modern with cells and cars and anything the gypsies can steal and sell. Because his father and brother are imprisoned, Pio becomes responsible for his family, and he pursues the gangster life with natural instincts, and, well, relish. Moreover, his 15 family members are actor Pio's real family, providing an unparalleled feel of the real. His mother, Iolanda, is a piece of Italian motherhood work that by now could be \"central casting.\"The writer/director's treatment is consistent and relentless: an unwavering close up of impoverished gypsy life, at odds with the \"Italians\" who surround them and at odds with a society that considers them outsiders, thieves, and liers. The streets are uniformly strewn with garbage, and when a building experiences arson, you are almost ready to say \"good riddance.\" Although so many close-ups of Pio become tiresome, no doubt can exist that you will forget this camera-ready actor whose eyes tell you the combat within his soul.Are you surprised Martin Scorsese is a producer?

Grandpa is nostalgic about the time when they were nomads, represented in the film by a horse. The story is about his grandson, a 14-year- old who wants to be considered an adult and join the family business. While he is given training, he is always told to stay home. However, when all the adult males are rounded up by police, he springs into action, collecting ransom for cars, stealing, selling drugs, etc. He is assisted by his African best friend, a point of irony as the blacks are looked down upon by the gypsies. Eventually, he has to decide whether to betray his friend.I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the director pointed out that the extended gypsy family was a real family of non-actors, and the script was based on stories they told of their lives. The portrait is of a culture where crime is their main source of income, and formal education is not valued (even though the boy has to get a girl to read him a text message on his phone). While the director has obvious sympathy for the gypsies, to many others it will serve as a warning to keep these people far from our shores.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Django Reinhardt was one of the most brilliant pioneers of European jazz and the father of Gypsy Swing. \"Django\" portrays one chapter in the musician's eventful life and is a gripping tale of survival. Constant danger, flight and the atrocities committed against his family could not make him stop playing. Rarely is an opening festival film so compelling and overwhelming that you feel as if the festival ended right there the trip to Berlin would have been justified. Reda Kateb as Django Reinhardt the gypsy musician with the German sounding name, made me forget I was watching an actor playing a part but felt like I was watching the jazz legend Django himself back from the great beyond in the flesh, carefully trimmed Gable moustache and all. This film like last year's Jazz Legend Berlin biopic \"Miles Ahead\" (Miles Davis) assumes that the audience knows the personality in question well enough not to require any back story and plunges right into a certain segment of the life under scrutiny. In actual fact, while Three fingered guitarist Django Reinhardt was highly regarded by black American Jazzmen such as Duke Ellington, Ornette Coleman, et alia, because his name is mainly associated with the french \"Le Hot\" jazz scene of the thirties and forties, he is not as well known to the general American public as he should be. Django was simply a musical genius whose hot jazz quintet was the hottest band around in France and surrounding countries up to and including the German occupation years of WW II. This film focuses on two things: The incredible music of Django with half a dozen virtuoso foot stomping musical sequences, and (2) the persecution of Gypsies under Nazi racism. The musical sections show in great detail the fantastic guitar fingerings of the inimitable Django as well as his backup musicians, notably the clarinetist who was also jamtastic. A German officer who is a great fan of Django's lines up a German tour for the Hot Quintet to entertain Nazi bigwigs in Germany. However there are restrictions that must be met supposedly removing all Black Jazz elements such as the Blues and certain percussion instruments deemed as racially impure by the Nazis. Django finally realizing that if he goes on the tour he will probably never return flees with his feisty mother and family south hoping to make it over the border to Switzerland and safety. Apprehended there he is forced to stage a concert for a group of high level Nazis at a luxurious lakeside villa, but the heat of Djangos hot jazz drives the Germans into a Frenzy and results in a riot. Django escapes in the confusion and survives the war. At the very end after France is liberated a Requiem he composed to honor the Exterminated Gypsies is played on a momentous church organ and Django's heroism is recognized. A final message on screen notifies us that all but the opening bars of Django's requiem were lost, but have been reconstructed by serious musicians to prove that Reinhardt was not only a virtuoso performer but a noteworthy composer as well. Magnificent, beyond words. C\u00e9cile de France was also captivating as Django's fictionalized Gadjo (Non-Gypsy) girlfriend who marries a Nazi to save her own life but risks it at the end to save Django, and the old woman who plays Django's mother is a scene stealer every time she appears. Director \u00c9tienne Comar has done both the film and music worlds a great service with this remarkable picture. PS: By no means to be confused with Q.

So, obviously this film is not Django Reinhardt's entire life story. It's a shame but I can certainly understand why they chose this path. If you want to know more about the man, check Wikipedia and go from there.The film picks up in the middle of WWII. Django is a big star in Paris and is even loved by the occupying Nazis. What makes this so unusual is that he was one of the Romani (aka Gypseys) and they were hated and persecuted by the Reich. Additionally, he played swing...a style music associated with black Americans...a group also despised by the German government. Problems develop when the Nazis insist he do a tour of Germany and Django is worried he'll never return. So, they decide to make a run for it. The movie is all about this period of time.The film is something I really appreciated because tons of films have been done about the Jewish Holocaust.

In a mixture of biopic and historical drama, Django fails in standing out from the crowd, walking down the one- dimensional route of escape from Nazi persecution, while rendering its characters secondary.Django Reinhardt, a guitarist of Romani ethnicity, is dazzling the crowds in Paris during the later days of the German occupation. The specter of deportation looms over his family, his band, yet he refuses to accept the idea that anyone would harm him, due to his positive notoriety. However, after declining to tour in Germany, a quick visit to a local police station makes him see the light, as he flees close to the Swiss border, awaiting transfer. There, he comes across a local Romani camp and they come together to perform music in the area, as a means for survival. That's pretty much the gist of the story, which is as bland as it sounds. After a great opening scene, followed by an equally impressive musical performance, the movie drifts into this grey area where not much happens. Reda Kateb's performance is strong enough to retain some interest, yet the production lingers without delving deeply into either Django's person, nor the plight of the Romani people. Whenever music starts playing, the film comes to life, but this is not sufficient to keep a rhythm.It's a shame, really, because there are glances of why Reinhardt could have been a relevant leading figure. Being unable to read or write, and bearing a childhood injury on his playing hand,his performances come from a deeply rooted passion for music, seemingly instilled by his Romani heritage and culture. This generates the contrast of music from the heart and music from the head, which is not subtle, yet it plays well with how ridiculously rigurous and lifeless Nazi censorship was. The close knit relations with his family, band and the fellow survivors he meets at the Swiss camp are well shaded against Reinhardt's privileged position, and his sense of entitlement. Yet, there is no clear sense of inner conflict, although the movie does imply that his personal quest is to learn some self sacrifice, putting himself second.This is part of the problem, that Django just can't set itself apart and come across without conviction. Supporting characters have little to no personality, and function as either plot enhancers, or easy to swap band members. Only the relationship between Reinhardt and his mother is distinguishing, even if it feels at times like comic relief. The generic portrayal of the Nazi oppressors doesn't help either, as is the case with some of the elliptical moments in the story. Even the name of the movie should have given pause for thought: how does one make something distinctive with such an overused title?Django would have been a much better experience, had it stuck to its music, especially as some of the artist's work was lost, which is a cause for grief. As another survival movie from the war, it falls flat, especially compared to some of the previously released hard-hitting productions, be they grim or soulful representations of the horror.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Director/Writer Etienne Comar (primarily a Producer \"Of God and Men\" 2010) brings forth yet another amazing untold story about the German occupancy, this time set in Paris. This poignant music filled production chronicles the life of gypsy musician Django Reinhardt (Red Kateb \"Zero Dark Thirty\" 2012). When Django (who became a renown European Jazz and Gypsy Swing aficionado) and his band \"Hot Quintet\" is hired to entertain Nazi's in Germany, at a time when Jazz, the Blues and certain percussion instruments and musical beats were forbidden, the event turns hostile and soon his family and friends are forbidden to live their encampment, the young are forced to join the resistance, and soon he flees for his life. Comar starts the film with camera work that is too jumpy and too close to its characters to understand what and why things are happening. However, once he abandons this format, and steps back and establishes the environment (beautiful cinematography by Christophe Beaucarne) and begins to tell the story, the film gains its footing and never lets go. The musical presentation (music by Warren Ellis) in this film, especially the final concert, are mesmerizing and not to be missed. I don't know if Kateb actually performed the various guitar arrangements, but if he did, his performance is to be rewarded. Supporting Django in a successful minor role is his wife Naguine (Bea Playa), his mother Negros (Bombay Merstein) with her spirited personality, his resistance lover Louise de Klerk (Cecile De France) and his various bandmates. I have to say, I was not initially sold on this film. However, when the story of survival presented itself, set against the beautiful music and harsh realities of the WWII Nazi occupancy, I couldn't help but become fully invested in the presentation.

So many crucial plot points just didn't make much sense and we not executed well at all. The opening scene was a classic example of where the protagonist can do no wrong, and all the antagonist have some of the worst aim and intellect of all time. The master plan was to board a ship that probably wouldn't even possibly be function able to sail to an unknown island that they somehow got word of without external knowledge. Thomas and co expected to break into the most heavily guarded place left on earth with literally no tools or knowledge to do so, and just for the plots sake got lucky enough to have just enough people crucial to the execution of the plan tag along in a very convenient time. If they hadn't have showed up when they did (in the tunnel) this movie could've ended 30 minuets in. Long story short, they team up with Gally, and somehow he knows how to get into a very heavily guarded city, as well as knows how to get someone onto a crane.There were SO many things wrong with their time in the city that it's a waste of time to write, but it's highlighted by how Brenda somehow drives a bus full of people around a city without getting quickly dismantled by police, and by how the bus gets picked up by a crane and dropped over a wall without any casualties. The end was a big disappointment to me, and there was no reason that Teresa couldn't have made it into the plane, that for some odd reason couldn't get 2-3 feet closer to the building. I understand why they killed her off, but it was just done clumsily. To top it all off, how long was Thomas asleep from a non-fatal gunshot wound? When he woke up, they were literally harvesting corn on a beach... but were still sleeping in hammocks. I guess they wanted watchers to assume he had been asleep for sometime or had been in a coma, but it seems like they just chose to throw logic out the door for one of the most important scenes in the whole series.

It can affect the intensity of your climax later and it puts the audience at unrest right from the get go. But that is exactly writer/director Scott Cooper's intention. Hostiles opens with one of the most violent scenes I can recall outside of the war and horror genres. It will make you uneasy and have you wondering, \"what exactly have I signed up for?\" This story takes place in a violent world; a world where even the best of men are dangerous men with blood on their hands. Cooper wants you to understand that, and to feel that from the start. And he accomplishes this with great precision.Hostiles follows renowned Army Captain Joseph Baker (Christian Bale) who is assigned the task of transporting a dying Native American Chief (Yellow Hawk played by Wes Studi) to his homeland in Montana where he can die in peace. This detail also includes transporting the Chief's family which includes his son (Adam Beach), daughter, daughter-in-law and grandson. Baker does not want this assignment. Yellow Hawk has been a war prisoner for some time, captured no doubt by Baker himself. The two men have seen each other commit violent acts against each other's soldiers and friends. There is understandable animosity between them and despite Baker's insistence that he does not want this mission, he has little choice in the matter if he wants to retire from the Army with his record unscathed and his pension intact. As his commanding officer, Colonel Briggs (Stephen Lang) tells him, \"This will be done. And it will be done by you.\" Not long after the Captain, his small team of soldiers and Yellow Hawk's family start their journey, they find Rosalie Quaid (Rosamund Pike), a woman in dire straits after just witnessing the murder of her entire family and the burning of her home at the hands of another Native American tribe. Baker and his men know they must take this woman with them, not just to protect her from further attack and the elements, but to protect her from herself. All of this takes place in the first fifteen minutes of the film. The rest I will leave you to discover on your own.For a movie that runs nearly a quarter past two hours, it is a wonder how it never drags. Had the film been released more in line with the awards season time frame, editor Tom Cross may well have seen his way to a few ceremonies. As would cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi, who has made a film so gorgeous that even the close-up shots look amazing. When it comes to the beautiful landscape, this is probably the best-looking Western since Open Range. The score by Max Richter is very subtle, it fits the tone of the film perfectly, never feeling intrusive, but not unnoticed.Every actor in this film is giving one of their finest performances. I'd go as far as to say this is Christian Bale's best performance since The Machinist, which is saying a lot since he's given so many great performances in between. Rosamund Pike's portrayal of a tortured soul feels authentic and heartbreaking. Wes Studi, Adam Beach, Rory Cochrane, Jonathan Majors, Stephen Lang, Jesse Plemons and Ben Foster all have opportunities to shine in smaller roles. Cochrane in particular shines as a soldier whose life of killing has finally taking its toll mentally and physically.Hostiles may just come across as depressing to some viewers. It is dark and violent and there is little levity to speak of. There is so much death on screen that at times the movie seems like it is a story about death. And in a way it is. The acts of violence in the film happen quickly, but the repercussions of those acts are dwelt upon. We bear witness to the effects of death in its various forms. As such the film becomes more than just a story about death, but one about our reconciliation with mortality; our understanding of an outcome that is inevitable for us all one way or another.Scott Cooper has created one of the best films of 2017. A haunting, emotional Western that you will not soon forget. A film that looks this good and that is this emotionally engrossing deserves to be seen on the big screen. And a film this well-made deserves an audience. So get to it. 9/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It's only that in Lebanon it has greater gravity and impact due to well-advertised, for more than half a century closely monitored, media covered multitude of regional and local political problems, ever so easily reviving and fuelling age-old animosities based on ethnic, religious and sectarian antagonisms, as well as rivalries between the autochthonous communities and migrants--whether economic immigrants, or internally and externally displaced refugees--ergo plethora of political, economic and humanitarian challenges.Actors did a good job, and although sometimes way to eloquent and theatrical, especially, not unexpectedly, lawyers in the courtroom scenes, at least they provide ample historical background which could explain but not justify all the buildup subsequent to otherwise an ordinary incident. However, silences and exchanged glances between conflicting protagonists, Toni, a Lebanese Christian (Adel Karam), and Yasser, a Palestinian refugee (Kamel El Basha), often speak even more than words! The very ending is a bit vague, but so is the broader context, involving multifaceted interests, creating tensions, eternal conflicts whatsoever, sadly, with no solution in sight, neither at present, nor in the foreseeable future?As it was mentioned by the end of the movie\u0085 nobody has monopoly for suffering. I would like to add\u0085 for happiness, neither, which makes it even harder to accept endlessly ongoing bitter realities people of (not only) Lebanon have to live.All in all, \"The Insult\" is a fine courtroom drama, which keeps you at the edge of the seat. It is an almost perfect Lebanese movie, fairly cut even for international audience, well worth seeing.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It is the new movie directed by Ziad Doueiri and tells the story of Toni a Christian Lebanese who got into a fight from an insult blown out with a Palestinian plumber. Haunted by their past and the civil war, they went really far with it and the movie took unexpected turns and surprises. Doueiri and Touma wrote a splendid courtroom drama script that is really tense, exciting and really fair for the two sides. It reminded me of the great Sidney Lumet movies with a touch of political background. That film has great characters rich with backup stories and it wouldn't be great without the marvelous cast. Each actors gave an Oscar worthy performance. Thumbs up for Karam, Hayek and Diamand Bou Abboud. I must give credits to Camille Salemeh because he led the show for sure! Doueiri worked hard on letting the actors give their best for the characters. Cinematography and score were also on a high level here! Doueiri is a superb director. His debut West Beirut has always been every Lebanese's favorite. The Insult was competing in Venice (It won best actor for Kamel Basha and had a 5 minutes standing ovation), Telluride, TIFF and it the official submission for Lebanon at the Oscars for best foreign language movie.

When a film opens with a statement that 'the views expressed are those of the authors and director, and not of the government of Lebanon', one quickly understands the difference in artistic freedom in that country versus what occurs in the United States, where cartoons and memes regularly poke fun at this country's President. Director Ziad Doueri and his co-writer Joelle Touma present an intense story of human nature that might happen anywhere, but since the leads are a Lebanese Christian and a Palestine refugee, that opening statement is warranted.One morning, a seemingly innocuous exchange between Tony (Adel Karam) and Yasser (Kamel El-Basha) takes place. While watering flowers on his balcony, the overflow sprays Yasser on the street below. Yasser, a city contractor, orders his team to fix the drainage issue, and Tony reacts violently - leading to Yasser delivering the titular insult. From there, all heck breaks loose. Apologies are requested and never delivered. Appeals to rational reconsideration are made. Tony's pregnant wife (an excellent Rita Hayek) pleads with him to let it go. Yasser's boss threatens him with termination. Still, two stubborn and prideful men refuse to give in.The subsequent courtroom drama feature other side stories, not the least of which is the relationship between the two opposing attorneys (Diamond Bou Abboud and Camile Salaheh), one a rising legal star and the other a veteran attempting to make up for a past failure. Emotions run high as two too-proud men turn what was little more than a playground standoff into a national incident being fought in the legal system and the media. Tony is a hot-head who somehow thinks an apology from Yasser is actually an apology for how Palestinians \"messed up this country\". Yasser's stoic nature barely shrouds his bitterness at the world since the Lebanon Civil War. History and childhood roots play a role, but mostly it's human nature that is at the core of this escalation.Though the title is not plural, there are multiple insults slung throughout the film, each reminding us of the power of words and the futility of the \"sticks and stones\" phrase. Our own prejudices and preconceptions alter our views and reactions, often preventing us from standing in the other fellow's shoes. Again, this situation could have played out in most any neighborhood on the globe, but this particular locale shows various ethnic and religious groups are still grappling with what it means to live together - despite the years of wars and unrest. We don't see a great deal of Middle Eastern cinema, but three days after I watched this film, it became the first ever movie from Lebanon to receive an Oscar nomination (Best Foreign Language Film) ... proving yet again that the language of cinema is universal.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

While \"West Beirut\" will forever remain my favorite movie, his latest effort, \"The Insult\", further confirms his skill as a talented storyteller. In short: it's one of the most intense Lebanese movies I've ever seen. What makes \"The Insult\" so good is the way Doueiri takes a seemingly ordinary situation and builds a web of suspense around it. Adel Karam (in one of the best performances of his career) plays Toni, a Lebanese christian who can't seem to let go of the past. One day, he gets into a heated argument with a Palestinian worker (played by an excellent Kamel El Basha), which leads to a domino-like sequence of unpredictable events. Doueiri masterfully explores the dark side of each character, especially as it relates to patriotism, politics, and the consequences of taking revenge. I'd say this is Doueiri's specialty, and the sense of discomfort he creates throughout this exceptional film will hold you in its grip at every turn. And when it ends, it leaves us with much food for thought, something that's been missing from most recent Lebanese films. Having been criticized so many times for not supporting local movies, it's refreshing to finally encounter something worth recommending. Ziad Doueiri's \"The Insult\" is a terrific achievement.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

One need only read the credits to understand that this is a personal project of Liu Jian. It's kind of comical to see his name come up as writer, director, illustrator, producer, and editor. He even wrote at least one of the songs featured in the film! An animated film from China that is clearly influenced by the likes of Quentin Tarantino and some modern day madcap caper films offers a nice respite from the typical January releases that hit the theatre.Jian's film is a crime thriller with socioeconomic subtext that hovers over each scene. An extended opening credits sequence provides the lay of the land (in this case, city) for the upcoming story. There is very little build up to the crime that ignites the cluster that follows. Xiao Zhang steals a bag filled with one million yuan. The bag belongs to \"Uncle Liu\", a feared crime lord and gangster who sends his trusted and ruthless hitman \"Skinny\" to retrieve his money.The old adage, \"follow the money\", comes into play here. Following the money is not as simple as it sounds, as these aren't brilliant criminal minds at work here.

This latest effort in the Kickboxer franchise is nothing new. Same old story-line. The movie has a great opening few minutes, very well shot action scenes, but then it descends into the usual farcical weaknesses - mainly the poor acting, direction, script and plain barmy plot. The fight sequences are quite well shot, but more attention is given to them than the actual acting and this leaves you not believing in it. Christopher Lambert looks like burst settee for much of the movie; our hero has no acting ability and Van Damme looks absolutely ludicrous. Lots of sequences and characters were plainly stolen from other movies; we have the mirror smashing scene from Enter the Dragon and Van Damme plays his role as mr miyagi, from Karate Kid. No matter that he is totally blind, he makes his way around the world, appearing to be able to see perfectly well, without eyes. So, the plot.... Well, our fighter is asked to fight a 6ft 10 inch 400lb fighter (they've added an inch to his real size for effect), when he refuses, they kidnap his girlfriend and put him in jail until he accepts. There, he is befriended by a ludicrously wacky set of prisoners, including Mike Tyson and Mr Van Damme, who for some reason sucks on a smokeless pipe for the whole movie. I suppose the hat and sunglasses mask how bad he is looking of late, but the pipe is a mystery? I don't need to spoil the ending, as I think you will have worked that one out already. There are lots of improbable characters, overplayed and badly acted - there isn't one who I can say comes out of the movie with any credibility on that score. Even Mr. Lambert doesn't convince as the baddy. This movie will appeal to anyone who likes mindless violence and can ignore the rest of the important stuff.... such as acting. It will also be attractive to the criminally insane and anyone with an IQ below 40. It's watchable, but you will find yourself open-mouthed at the sheer stupidity of it all sometimes. It does make you chuckle quite a lot. The huge fighter that our hero is to fight, is well-known to strongest man fans, but despite his impressive stature, occasionally he looks frighteningly like Ricky Gervais.

My favourite of the London Film Festival so far", "author": "Richard Burin", "postedDate": "9 October 2017", "reviewContent": "This is really, really good.(opens a can of wasps)I'm always struck by the sky-high ratings on IMDb for bad LGBT movies, and wonder if it's attributable to a) the comparative paucity of these films, meaning that we should celebrate those we get, regardless of their technical or artistic deficiencies (the extension, I suppose, is the tribalistic mindset this engenders, in which you can't judge them as bad films, as they're not just films); b) my lack of insight into what these films should be doing in relation to their audience and LGBT issues in 2017.(/can of wasps)Anyway, no such ruminations necessary on this one, it's bloody brilliant: a dazzling, poetic, sometimes dream-like Chilean film about a trans woman (Daniela Vega) trying to hold it together \u2013 and reach some point of resolution \u2013 after the death of her boyfriend. I should mention that his family aren't helping.Vega has the most fascinating face and the camera makes the most of it, not least in a dazzling nightclub sequence that moves from pain to sensuality to a fantasy dance number, but there's such depth to her characterisation too, and the film's refusal to give her easy, sassy victories is uniquely satisfying, grappling profoundly and humanely with issues that are both specific and universal.The effect is of a Dardennes story adapted by Almodovar, but I haven't seen anyone like Vega before. I'm not sure she can really sing classical (the best use of 'Ombra mai fu' is now and forever in Humphrey Jennings' seismic short film, Spare Time, Handel fans), but the rest of the music's a treat, with British composer Matthew Herbert delivering an audial dreamscape that like the script, photography and performances serves to conjure a very particular mood.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt5639354", "movieTitle": "A Fantastic Woman", "title": "Moving, Confronting, but not without its flaws", "author": "Sam Cannon", "postedDate": "25 March 2018", "reviewContent": "A Fantastic Woman is a very simple film, far more simple than it initially appears. Essentially the story boils down to this: A transgender woman has to deal with the family of her lover after his sudden and unexpected death. The film deals with themes of transphobia and grief, and it explores those particular themes very well, in some very confronting and uncomfortable ways, but from a story and character perspective, this film often leaves a lot to be desired.Marina, the titular 'Fantastic Woman', is defined purely by the fact that she's transgender. This isn't a big flaw per se, as the film is explicitly about how the culture of Chile and the world at large responds to that fact, but she doesn't really have much character besides that. She's a singer, she boxes, and she's very driven to get what she wants, despite the high amounts of adversity she faces throughout the film. The driving force of her character is her desire to pay her respects to her dead boyfriend one last time, while his family refuses to give her that, seeing her as a shameful part of his final moments, best forgotten. She isn't given that much development besides that, and it leaves us with a very one, maybe two-dimensional character with no real flaws that have consequences within the story.However the main issue I have with the film is that it basically abandons several plot threads as it goes along. Early in the film, there is some suspicion of foul play surrounding the boyfriend's death and she, being the last person to be with him, is the prime suspect. However this is mostly abandoned after one particularly uncomfortable scene where she is forced to have a physical examination by the detective and a doctor, which after its conclusion is basically hand waved away without much further thought. It is not brought up again (to my recollection) as to whether she is still seen as somehow complicit in her boyfriend's death, or whether the police decided to abandon the case altogether.Another plot thread that seemed to be abandoned is the entire opening scene, where it establishes the couple's relationship before the man dies, where he mentions buying tickets to see a famous waterfall in 10 days time, but has misplaced the tickets. To my memory, she never finds the tickets or goes to the waterfall to do anything after the conclusion of the movie. It just seems like another missed opportunity for further development.I do want to make clear though, that I do think this film is still worth watching. Transgender characters are still relatively rare in film and television, and even when they do pop up every now and then, they are often portrayed by non-transgender actors in heavy makeup. However Daniela Vega is herself transgender, and she plays the role, limited as it is, incredibly well. The cinematography is also quite beautiful, and there are several visual setpieces that looked great (while not really serving much purpose to the plot) It's definitely something worth watching on the big screen, but I probably won't put it on for a second time.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

This film depicts a reality which cannot be ignored. It delivers punches to the gut opening our eyes to the urgency of not special, but equal rights. Marina demands she be treated with decency and respect as a human. She seeks no special rights or anything else than what she believes is owed to her as a grieving woman who just lost her loved one. \nThe films is urgent and poses many questions to the viewer to ponder. You can't help to think about the actions you would take facing the grim choices Marina has to deal with. She is constantly stripped from her dignity in the midst of grieving. But her sense of hope is palpable. She will not let anyone get in the way of her having that last moment she needs to say goodbye. This film really keeps you choked up for many reasons simultaneously until the very end when you feel somewhat a sense of vindication for Marina.

I remember sitting at the end seeing the end credits roll through and seeing the name \"Joe Carman\" and then the names of all of his four daughters all with the last name \"Carman\", and part of me couldn't accept that this film was real. Joe is an amateur UFC fighter, who just turned 40 in the film. This film will appeal to anyone who's interested in mixed-martial arts and wants to see what goes on behind the flashy fights we see on Pay-per-view, what we don't see\u2014the intense training before sunrise, the belittlement from coaches, the ups and downs of family life, and interesting hobbies of the fighters (Joe maintains a couple goats). But the real story is the family story. Director Jeff Unay puts us into intimate spaces like the living room, the kitchen, and the doctor's office. He makes it feel shockingly close. He made us feel like we were in the cage during the fight. And in the audience of the fight. And in the bathroom after vomiting because we had just been punched in the gut. He shot this so well, it was ridiculous. Joe's family wants him to quit fighting; they have trouble understanding why he continues to do it. Joe is conflicted himself \u2013 he deeply loves his family, but he can't stop putting himself and his health at risk, because of the feeling of independence he gets being in the ring, one on one, with a competitor. It's not just Joe. Every character in this film is two people at once \u2013 Joe's wife is angry and resolute, and then she's troubled and scared. Some scenes with the daughters and you think it's the happiest family in the world. Other moments you think it's the most difficult family in the world. Opponents in the ring are portrayed as brutish mutes, and later in the film, we discover that they're kind and empathetic. I couldn't believe that the people in this film weren't actors. I studied acting, and studied boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. These were ordinary people but they had extraordinary presence on screen, whether it was Joe's mom pleading with her aging husband to stop yelling at her 40-year old son, or Joe's teenage daughters fighting among themselves whether to confront dad or accept dad. In one scene, we see three of Joe's teenage daughters in a parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, arguing about whether or not to bring up at home the pain their dad's fighting was causing them. It was like Unay knew exactly where to be, exactly when to be there, and exactly when to focus the camera and when to zoom in.Joe's captured rolling around in the grass with his daughters in a park, seconds later, he's beating the hell out of a punching bag on the ground at his training gym. You decide the type of man he is. I saw this at the world premiere, and during the Q&A, one woman after a couple of questions had been asked, shouted out of turn at Joe and his family on stage, \"Stop fighting!\" Immediately afterwards, a man from a different part of the crowd, and there were some MMA guys in attendance, shouted, \"Keep fighting\". It was an awkward moment, not because they were both wrong, but because they were both right. For anyone looking to understand why Joe does what he does, I recommend reading, \"Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging\" by Sebastian Junger, for answering what it means to be a warrior in the modern world.There's also beautiful footage of the Pacific Northwest here so anyone from this region will be sure to enjoy that too. Overall, I strongly recommend seeing this film. There's some aspects of it everyone will relate to, being passionate about something, having difficulties with one's families, and ultimately leaving us raw. 10 out of 10.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The story of Pio's (Pio Amato) coming of age in an impoverished Romani enclave is told with unremitting neo-realism and a point of view almost exclusively young 14 year-old Pio's. It's a companion piece to the director's Mediterranea and a sequel.Realism is what made Italian cinema its reputation as far back as Rossellini in the first half of the 20th century. This iteration dares to place the camera almost on Pio's shoulder to give the sense of everything Pio is seeing and if his decisions are good ones. It doesn't get more than this.That's the rub of this powerful, seemingly documentary capture of small-life in Calabria, modern with cells and cars and anything the gypsies can steal and sell. Because his father and brother are imprisoned, Pio becomes responsible for his family, and he pursues the gangster life with natural instincts, and, well, relish. Moreover, his 15 family members are actor Pio's real family, providing an unparalleled feel of the real. His mother, Iolanda, is a piece of Italian motherhood work that by now could be \"central casting.\"The writer/director's treatment is consistent and relentless: an unwavering close up of impoverished gypsy life, at odds with the \"Italians\" who surround them and at odds with a society that considers them outsiders, thieves, and liers. The streets are uniformly strewn with garbage, and when a building experiences arson, you are almost ready to say \"good riddance.\" Although so many close-ups of Pio become tiresome, no doubt can exist that you will forget this camera-ready actor whose eyes tell you the combat within his soul.Are you surprised Martin Scorsese is a producer?

Eventually, he has to decide whether to betray his friend.I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the director pointed out that the extended gypsy family was a real family of non-actors, and the script was based on stories they told of their lives. The portrait is of a culture where crime is their main source of income, and formal education is not valued (even though the boy has to get a girl to read him a text message on his phone).

I only really sort of didn't like the acting, which I will discuss later, but for the most part I had no issues with this film, which is not over-patriotic flag waving propaganda like many anti-military Liberals will say it is. Its a story about the lives of men as well as when bravery is forced upon average citizens.First off, about the acting, the Americans didn't do the best job, but that is understandable because these are not actors, but the real men who were there. So its very clear that they are untrained actors, even with the help of veteran actor Clint Eastwood. The story was well put together, chronicling the lives of the heroes in question.

We see the 3 main characters childhood and honestly I didn't care about it at all. Some typical bullying in school, everything was pretty pointless in terms of characterization. Then the glorious \"join the military\" phase and some scenes at the military, nothing new, more pointless scenes, I couldn't have cared less. Later then the trip to Europe - as somebody who grew up in Europe and traveled to all of those locations I have to say the shots in Europe were poorly made. I don't know if that's Mr. Eastwoods fault or who was responsible - for somebody who has never been in Europe you get the wrong ideas - everywhere. Funny as always - people who are supposed to be Germans speaking with a nice American accent - but that's in almost all American movies.Finally a few scenes on the train, the terrorist gets disarmed in like 2 minutes, some drama then about a guy who got shot and then we have some kind of emotional moment when actual footage of French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande presenting the three men with the L\u00e9gion d'honneur was used.

Can't we just enjoy it? Why does it have to be so complicated? I can think of a million other things that are much worse--than this Peter Rabbit film, which by the way, there is nothing wrong with Peter Rabbit 3.0. Go see it. You're going to love it, as much as I would've felt the original author would have too, as this is based on her tale for kids, but it is technically a sequel--as you will understand when you see it. First off, they are rabbits, and rabbits are mischievous by nature, when they are bored or there is food at stake. They are also a bit affectionately demanding and territorial as they felt with Bea. Within the context of the film, rabbits don't understand what the implications of allergic reactions could be for humans--they are, yes, rabbits. The humor is just hilarious, and it works well coming from farm animals. This is CGI/A vs. real live humans. It kept me engaged throughout. I saw this one with my daughter and we both laughed so much and so hard -- isn't this what it is all about? a positive experience? One that brings you closer with those you are with? I cried, I laughed, I cried so hard I laughed, and laughed so hard I cried -- and this is how I rate/gauge film I watch -- by how it moves me and the positivity it inspires in me; it felt good to be reminded that I was still human. I just loved, loved, loved this film. I recommend it. This one will definitely make it into my collection once it is released in media format -- and not many make it in. The soundtrack is super amazing too--I can't stress that enough. They hit it on the head with this one. A TRUE STORY OF HUMBLENESS AND REDEMPTION. Your heart will melt into a big puddle--hands down.

There is nothing right about her actions. She always projected her feeling, anxieties and desires on Will, which made it seem like all they did, was either his idea, or theirs, when it was always hers. She uses Dane, then condemns him to a state of emotional uncertainty and purgatory hell because of her malicious actions and failings. She then has intercourse with a complete stranger, who is also married, and once again, projects her TOTAL BS on him, when the problem is her. And then to top it off, after breaking Dane, she goes and shatters Will, in true Anna fashion.I really like Rebecca Hall, however this role was a terrible choice, and her producing this film made it even worse. The subject matter of this film is nonsense, which is sad because the fact is, it is a true reflection of love today, however, the film felt rushed towards the end, and the execution wasn't necessarily the best. Permission tried to create scenarios where nobody was at fault; Anna, Will, Hale and Reece, but failed, miserably.The after taste of Permission makes it feel like it deserves less than a 5/10, it really, really does, especially because it arrogantly perpetuates a life style contained in this vicious cycle most can't seem to escape, however, while watching it, I never really felt it deserved less, so, 5/10 it is.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Maybe Marvel movies are not at the top of my wish list, but I was curious enough to give it a willing try. Besides, it was a holiday and I had time to spend with my kid.Boy, was I disappointed.I found the story to be far-fetched, schematic, and uninvolving. Maybe that last quality is its greatest sin. I can deal with traditional story motives, good vs. bad, your occasional plot twist (to be seen miles ahead), but there must be more to a movie to grasp an audience's emotions. This movie did not do that for me, and seeing the lukewarm attention that it got for the other people in the cinema, it did not do the trick for them either. What didn't particularly help was the wooden acting with the stiffest wood grain. It is as if most actors read their lines from a visual script, and were too busy doing that to offer more than high-school level acting. The only sad excuse may be that this movie is a derivative of a comic, so the dialogue was exactly as stiff, exaggarated, and unnatural as in any comic book.The visuals, then. If you are a fan of over-the-top carnivalesque stages and dresses and, ahem, state-of-the-art CGI that has to make up for a lack of true cinematography, then this movie is for you. I know it is an action movie, but does that really mean that the makers need to test the audience's susceptibility to epilepsy? It is a poor man's shock & awe to the senses.In all, we sat the show out, had an ice-cream, then moved on to wider horizons.At home, I checked the IMDB score and couldn't believe my eyes. A 7.9 for this mess of a movie? I can understand temporary 'popularity', but this is ridiculous. I don't fall easily for conspiracy theories and scores being 'bought' by companies, but there is no explaining a 7.9 for 'Black Panther'.Next, I looked at IMDB's user reviews. I noticed that they were much less favorable than the 'user ratings' indicate. No really, there is a HUGE gap between 'user ratings' and 'user review' ratings. How can that be explained?So I checked the last nearly 300 reviews. What did I find?People who took the trouble to write a few paragraphs about this movie, gave an average 4.3 to 'Black Panther'. A 4.3! That is nearly half of the rating the movie supposedly received from IMDB users in general. This is a ridiculous difference. IMDB may have its own algorithm to arrive at some 'weighted average', but that cannot account for this huge gap.Here is a breakdown of the ratings awarded by 'IMDB user reviewers':\n10 - 5,5%\n9 - 4.5%\n8 - 3.4%\n7 - 8.3%\n6 - 16.6%\n5 - 15.5%\n4 - 10.3%\n3 - 8.3%\n2 - 8.6%\n1 - 19%Please note that only 13.4% of IMDB user reviewers awarded 'Black Panther' with an 8, 9 or 10. While according to IMDB, no less than 66.4% of 'IMDB users' have given these ratings. Sorry, this cannot be rationally explained, unless one makes untenable assumptions about the difference between 'users' and 'reviewers'.In conclusion: all I can offer is my personal opinion about this movie. I am sorry that I invested time and money into seeing it. Neither my kid of 12 enjoyed it, neither did I. We had to choose between Disney's 'Coco' and 'Black Panther'. I think I'll make up for the disappointment of BP by taking my kid to 'Coco'.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt4701724", "movieTitle": "Early Man", "title": "Sending up the Stone Age and football", "author": "TheLittleSongbird", "postedDate": "31 January 2018", "reviewContent": "Although not the biggest fan of football, that it's from Aardman (responsible for gems like 'Wallace and Gromit', 'Creature Comforts', 'Chicken Run' and 'Shaun the Sheep', have not seen anything bad from them actually), being a family film/animation fan and that it had so many talented actors in the voice cast was enough to convince me to see 'Early Man'.Seeing it, 'Early Man' is not one of Aardman's best and it doesn't see them at the top of their game. Then again, with a studio as consistently very good to great as Aardman, that is not a standard that can be reached constantly. It is nonetheless a very worthy effort from them and as a family film, and a film in general, 'Early Man' to me was immensely enjoyable. There is a lot of talent on board and the film doesn't waste it. 'Early Man' does lose a little of its lustre, in pace and material, towards the end, the one part where the story's predictability is most obvious (up to this point the gags, inventive visuals and puns made things feel fresh) and less overlook-able. The easily foreseeable conclusion is also a little too pat.Otherwise, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, could find little else to fault 'Early Man'. Visually, the film is a delight. It is rich in colour and detail, the characters are adorable and cleverly modelled and there is some nice visual invention here, like the cave paintings. One is genuinely immersed in this colourful Stone Age world. The music score is suitably energetic and really gives the film its momentum and adds to it.As to be hoped, 'Early Man' really entertains...hugely, both in sending up the Stone Age and football. Despite how mismatched it sounds having Stone Age inhabitants having their version of football, the combination actually goes very well. Any film that helps me appreciate football better, like 'Early Man' did, is worthy of any kind of credit. The gags come thick and fast, there's plenty of them and they are subtle, clever and often hilarious, in typical Aardman fashion. Love their versions of technology, like the beetle electric shaver and the crocodile clothes pegs. There are some inspired puns and wordplay, like the duo of football pundits, primordial soup and the name Goona. 'Early Man' makes a lot of effort appealing to kids and adults alike and succeeds in doing that.Kids will be thoroughly absorbed in the action and the inventive ideas and technology while adults will love, or at least appreciate, the puns (which they are actually more likely to get) and there is even a Mud reference to get nostalgic over. The pacing is spirited and tight throughout, and while the story is not much new and loses steam towards the end the energy and that it never goes wayward are to be applauded.Characters are uniformly engaging, from the likeable protagonist, hilarious supporting characters to the camp villains. The voice cast are a talented bunch and they are all terrific, even those who raises some initial surprise in their involvement (i.e. Eddie Redmayne and Maisie Williams) do a great job, while Timothy Spall, Mark Williams and Tom Hiddleston (experienced in villain roles and not unfamiliar to voice work, both of them obvious) are standouts.In summary, immensely enjoyable family fare for something for all ages. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Aardman once again uses expert sight gags and word play to generate multiple laughs from the audience and, although the jokes don't always land, they are all genuinely clever and you can't help but appreciate the thought that has gone into them all. The film is however let down slightly by its somewhat generic and predictable story, but the fast pace and constant humour doesn't make this into a huge problem.

Sorry.I really enjoy Aardman's work, especially from shows like \"Shaun the Sheep\" and \"Wallace & Gromit\". Their claymation is unique, the slapstick is inventive, the British wit is keen, the characters are endearing and the stories are funny. Only a few of these qualities could describe Early Man, a movie that's pleasant and wacky enough but felt rather uninspired. Which pains me, because I know Aardman could do better.What are the positives? First off, the claymation has the same offbeat charm as almost every Aardman film ever, so expect that. A few of the gags are inventive and got some giggles outta me (like the replay footage in a soccer game is a literal puppet show. Whenever the caveman team wins, the puppeteers wildly exaggerate what happened.). Some of the details of how the caveman live their lives was amusing. The pig was adorable and the end picks up it's pace with an entertaining soccer game. Nick Park has a knack for world-building, and this was no different.But I think that's where the main positives end. What shocked me the most was how formulaic the story was, since you could predict what EVERY SINGLE PLOT POINT was if you've seen enough animated movies. Some of the gags are clever and quirky, but a good chunk of them are also lazy and tired. It seems to rely on dumb puns (\"looks like the caveman caved!\") and overused physical humor over actually ingenious sight gags. The \"look at that caveman! He's so dumb!\" running gag got old after the first 15 minutes and any chances for good absurdist humor (giant man-eating duck) lost its steam along the way. The CGI backgrounds look tacky and dull compared to the claymation, so it doesn't fit. The characters are likeable but also stereotypical (hero wants to save land, villain loves money, love interest is good at soccer, chief leader is cautious, sidekicks are dumb yet useful), just like the majority of this movie.But it's not a painful watch. It's sometimes funny and amusing, but with every good moment you still have a thin premise, predictable plot and cliches to move the story forward as an amiable but weak experience. It's the type of movie you could show your kids on a Sunday afternoon or on an airplane, but the eccentricity, wit and creativity just isn't enough to make it worth seeing by yourself in a theater.

Aiyaary is not an complete action film at all, but rather a suspenseful espionage thriller, and a damn good one at that too (for those who can appreciate).STORY: A colonel, Abhay Singh and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Major Jai Bakshi have a lasting relationship in the Indian Army and another unit. During surveillance when Jai, however, discovers the real inside to the country's system, he goes astray, carrying a secret which could bring down the government. Abhay only has a limited amount of time to catch the rogue agent and bring him back, before it's too late...DIRECTION/WRITING: The writing overall is ok, but at times is very clumsy. The story is good, but the writing does spoil it a bit. The film starts off quite slow with the usual Neeraj trademark - a scattered storyline, and usually with his other films everything comes to light very quickly. However with this film it takes longer than normal to make sense of what's happening, and eats up half of the first half of the film. Astonishingly it takes even longer than that to establish some of the small but important characters. Pandey takes the best of the writing and creates a gripping thriller and a rather interesting cat and mouse chase. The film keeps you gripped in your seats, and some scenes are perfectly executed for this. But Neeraj couldn't save a few clumsily written scenes, with which the film can then test your patience to some extent. A few people might find themselves completely bewildered by the whole story and incomplete arcs, and maybe give bad word-of-mouth, but the majority will be content with the running and those who can appreciate will be ones most enjoying this film.CAST: Siddarth Malhotra is a complete natural for his role and I could not think of any other actor who could act Jai Bakshi better. Manoj Bajpayee puts the most effort into his role, and makes it look effortless. He aces this role with ease, and looks great while doing it. Rakul Preet Singh is ok but wasn't really necessary for this film. Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah have minimal roles but act them very well. The casting is quite good and this film could be seen just for everyone's performances alone.EDITING: Editing is one of this film's biggest cons. The film just has not been edited well at all. The film's length at 157 minutes could have been trimmed down a lot, especially around the start region. The film, however, is very gripping, and it goes by quickly, which is good for this.MUSIC: There are only three songs to the album, but only one is put into the film, Lae Dooba, which is sung well by Sunidhi Chauhan. Yaad Hai and Shuru Kar fail to impress, and they picked the best out of the lot for the film. The songs do not interrupt the flowing narrative, which lets the movie go on and keeps the grip.DIALOGUES: There are not many, but some clap-worthy dialogues worth listening to in the film.Despite its let-downs, Aiyaary is the designated espionage thriller for Bollywood full of suspense and some action, which keeps the audience in their seat for more. Neeraj Pandey has done a great job to overcome its flaws. The film is definitely not one of the best of Neeraj's, but it is one to watch.

{"imdbId": "tt6951892", "movieTitle": "Samson", "title": "Not even close to a faithful representation of the Bible", "author": "starrywar", "postedDate": "18 February 2018", "reviewContent": "I went in with an open mind--didn't read any of the reviews, etc. I wish I would have. They tried to make this a story about a humble man in love who made some bad choices, but that is not the story of Samson. Samson was a proud man who had been strong all his life (and took it for granted) and was driven by lust. I understand certain liberties here and there, but when they try to make the story about love and forgiveness, that is not Samson's story. The only time Samson asked God for strength was at the very end when he was blind and his hair had started to grow back. Then he asked God to give him strength one last time to avenge him for his two eyes. It was then that he killed more Phillistines at his death than he had during his life. I liked the actors, the costumes, the scenery. Discrepancies abounded: The dialogue from the Bible wasn't even used most of the time. There was a younger brother Samson never had. What should have been in the movie, but wasn't: Samson's wife had pressed him for the answer to the riddle for the 7 days of the feast (not just the last night) under threat of death from the Phillistines. Samson set the Phillistines cornfields on fire after her father gave her to his companion because he was angry with her(which was also not in the movie) After Samson's wife was burned to death with her father, he announced he would be avenged for the Phillistines killing her and that is when he killed them with a great slaughter. After the men of Judah \"delivered\" Samson to the Philistines is when he used the jawbone of an ass and killed 1,000 men. \n Delilah had been approached by the lords of the Phillistines and promised 1100 pieces of silver from each of them if she found out the secret of his great strength. Clearly, the woman never loved him, she was just using him. He lied to her several times and she said \"the Phillistines are upon you\" each time, and each time he got out. She got mad at him and kept after him until he finally told her his secret. She never had remorse for betraying him, she was only in it for the money. This was as frustrating and disappointing as the revisionist version of the Bible miniseries by Roma Downey and Mark Bennett. I never thought Christians would butcher the Bible as badly as Hollywood has (think of Noah and Exodus). I expected better from Pure Flix. The people who read the Bible and know the story will be upset (as I was) with the lack of respect given to the word of God. Those who didn't read the Bible before the movie probably won't after this to get the real story, but even if they do, they'll probably wonder why they didn't stick to the truth since that's what we're supposed to be about. If they wanted a redemptive story, they could have had it narrated by a father in the future Israel teaching his sons not to be like Samson who was driven by pride and lust.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt6304162", "movieTitle": "Loveless", "title": "Selfies, selfishness and sex: a pessimistic view on society", "author": "Teyss", "postedDate": "3 October 2017", "reviewContent": "\"Nelyubov\" (\"Loveless\") starts as a psychological movie about a divorcing couple, then evolves into a thriller after their child disappears, focusing on the search. Yet overall it is a critical view on modern society, notably Russian.*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***The tone is pessimistic. The story focuses on a few individuals, however news heard on the radio or TV are depressing: the end of the world, corruption, war (Ukraine). Characters are confronted to a harsh environment: at work, bosses impose their arbitrary views to employees (no divorce, religion); the police cannot assist to find a missing child; missing children are commonplace.The main victims of society are children. They are not desired: Zhenya wishes she had aborted; none of the parents want to keep Alyosha; we understand Boris' girlfriend got pregnant \"by accident\". They are not taken care of: Zhenya did not have any milk for Alyosha when he was a baby (a revealing metaphor); Zhenya and Boris only realise after two days that their son is missing; at the end, Boris removes the crying baby instead of taking care of him.All this is a repetition of the past: Zhenya was not desired by her mother either and now has harsh contacts with her. Hence we feel that eventually children will grow up to be like their parents, forever perpetuating the lack of love within families. This perpetuation is emphasised by similar shots at the beginning and end of the movie: empty snowy landscapes with the same tense music.The \"loveless\" context spreads to all relationships: Zhenya tells Anton she loves him but he does not answer; at the restaurant, a young lady easily gives her mobile number to a complete stranger\u0085 before sitting down with her date. People only care about themselves: what matter most is wealth (Zhenya's comment about Anton), appearance (the beauty parlour) and social media (various selfies). Symbolically, when the coordinator questions Alyosha's friend at school, the blackboard in the background shows cold mathematical formulas instead of words or drawings (detail emphasised afterwards when the teacher erases the board).The atmosphere is not only bleak: it deteriorates progressively, noticeably after Alyosha's disappearance. This evolution is illustrated in different ways:1. SITUATIONS. At the beginning, Zhenya and Boris are separating cruelly, but are hoping for a fresh start in new relationships. These are shown in parallel, always in the same two apartments, highlighting their similarities and hence developing a systemic view on couples. First, the vision seems positive: the two new couples each have dialogues and a long erotic scene. However, couples then slowly drift apart: dialogues are reduced, doubts about the relationship emerge, there are no erotic or tender scenes any more. Finally, couples are physically separated despite being in the same home: Anton watches TV while Zhenya practices on the balcony; Boris watches TV while his girlfriend talks to her mother in the kitchen.2. IMAGE. To start with, shots highlight the tension between Zhenya and Boris, living together unwillingly: the camera uses long focals (sharp foregrounds, blurred backgrounds); frames are saturated (Boris in the crowded elevator, Zhenya in the crowded metro, close shots on the tray at the canteen, etc.). After Alyosha disappears, characters seem lost among high buildings, deserted places and endless forests. They increasingly bump against elements: cold and wet weather, metal fences (twice), large river, gigantic radar in the middle of the forest. Noises are menacing: barking dogs, traffic, planes, etc.3. PLACES. After Alyosha disappears, cosy apartments are replaced by Zhenya's mother's neglected house, then a huge derelict building, then a dreadful mortuary. The sequence in the derelict building is pivotal: it used to be a pleasant place of gathering (room with many seats), music (standing piano) and enjoyment (beautiful art deco bar); all is now destroyed. The schoolyard, where children ran at the very beginning of the movie, is now empty, just filled with snow. At the very end, Alyosha's bedroom is torn down and completely reworked: the little that remained of the boy's soul is definitely gone.4. ALYOSHA. The boy actually is the main role: he opens the movie and is very present in the first part; after he disappears the entire plot revolves around his search. Yet we never see him again: this vacuum becomes the icon of a soulless society. The only elements that eventually remain from him are the posters with his picture, scattered in empty places, and the tape he threw into the tree at the beginning: two derisory reminders of his existence. (Side note: the tape is striped red-and-white for safety, announcing the forthcoming tragedy.)The overall message is: we could have built a convivial society, but instead brought void and selfishness. Economic conditions can only partly be blamed since characters belong to middle or upper class. At the end, Zhenya is running on a machine, outside in winter, wearing a training suit proudly showing \"RUSSIA\": this cold society seems to be moving, but it is standing still, going nowhere. Meanwhile, Anton and Boris are watching propagandist news on TV. The allegory could hardly be more explicit: it is common knowledge that Zvyagintsev is very critical towards his country in general and the present government in particular.That said, \"Nelyubov\" has a few downsides. First, it is almost too skillful: messages and codes ooze from every situation, with minutely crafted images. Also, the vision is hopeless: nobody is truly positive, except maybe Alyosha who precisely disappears and the volunteers who mostly remain anonymous (the exception being the coordinator, who is nevertheless severe). Last, characters are somewhat stereotyped: to summarise, women are hysterical and men autistic. All these elements render the movie relatively one-sided, almost cynical: everything is thrown overboard.Nonetheless, \"Nelyubov\" remains an aesthetically impressive movie, to the extent that it never feels long despite its minimal action. Zvyagintsev again demonstrates he now is one of the leading Russian directors. His mastery seems to increase with every movie.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt6304162", "movieTitle": "Loveless", "title": "Reflects the growing emptiness of human relationships", "author": "Howard Schumann", "postedDate": "15 October 2017", "reviewContent": "Whether or not it is designed as an allegory of modern Russia, no film in recent memory has examined the growing emptiness of human relationships with such expressive force as Andrei Zvyagintsev's (\"Leviathan\") Loveless, a heart wrenching drama about a couple on the brink of divorce whose emotional neglect of their son leads to devastating consequences. Though the film has been characterized as \"bleak,\" the feeling tone is more like sadness and regret that many today have lost the capacity for compassion and empathy. Accompanied by Evgeny Galperin's rich cascading piano score, the film opens as cinematographer Mikhail Krichman surrounds us with the quiet beauty of a Russian winter.Almost immediately, we are staring at an cold-looking stone building that could easily be a prison in Siberia. There is no sound or movement. Suddenly a door opens and children, released from school, swarm through its exits. Though some are laughing, it is not a happy scene. 12-year-old Aloysha (Matvey Novikov) makes his way home through a barren forest but there are no warm greetings awaiting him. The marriage between his mother, beauty-salon owner Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) and his father Boris (Alexey Rozin, \"Leviathan\"), a desk-ridden management functionary, is over. Seeking status, money, and freedom, both are immersed in new relationships. Boris is with the pregnant Masha (Marina Vasilyeva, \"Name Me\") and Zhenya with the well-to-do business executive Anton (Andris Keishs, \"What Nobody Can See\").Though their apartment has been advertised for sale and their divorce is in its final stages, custody of Alyosha has not yet been agreed upon. It is clear that he is an unwanted child, the result of an unexpected pregnancy and a marriage of convenience. Like emotionless machines, the warring couple continue their repetitive spiral of mutual recrimination as Alyosha crouches behind the bathroom door. Fearful and alone he absorbs every last ounce of malice, his face becoming contorted into a mass of silent tears that well up from deep within his being. It is a shocking scene that mirrors every despair the world has ever known.Since the film takes place in the year 2012, talk radio focuses on the Mayan calendar and its apocalyptic date in December. News reports tell us about the bloody war in the Ukraine. Amidst the barely-controlled paranoia in the air, Boris tells a co-worker that he is afraid to lose his job if his boss, a fundamentalist Christian, finds out about his impending divorce. Fear of losing his job becomes secondary, however, when Zhenya tells him that Alyosha has not shown up for school for two days and is now missing. Far from coming together to patch up their differences, however, the estranged couple only double-down on their mutual acrimony.The inefficient police offer little expectation that they can find the boy and try to reassure the parents that, in most cases, a missing child is with a friend or relative or out on an adventure and will soon return home. Not satisfied with officialdom's inertia, they turn to a volunteer group who put up posters, talk to teachers and neighbors. An interview with Alyosha's only friend points them to an abandoned apartment in the middle of a forest. In a scene of eerie darkness where there is a palpable feeling of hopelessness and loss, the rescuers, wearing bright orange jackets, comb every space in the decrepit building but Alyosha is not found.A boy matching Alyosha's description is found at a nearby hospital but it is not him, and a subsequent visit to the morgue only offers more tears. Taking a risk, the two visit Alyosha's mother but the visit only succeeds in bringing hatred up to a level of ecstasy. With no explanation in sight, Zvyagintsev teases us with the sight of an unknown man walking alone into the forest, a man hidden from the camera in a fancy restaurant asking a call girl for her phone number which she provides while looking directly into the camera, a man pausing at a bus stop to read the flier about the missing boy, then turning and walking away, and a teacher cleaning her blackboard after students have left.These tantalizing scenes, however, do not bring us any closer to a solution to the mystery of Alyosha's disappearance. Loveless is a deeply disturbing film that explores the dark places of human behavior, upending our most cherished beliefs about the bond between parents and children. Making it clear about what can happen when an unwanted child is brought into the world, Anton tells Zhenya that no one can survive a life without love. If Loveless serves as any kind of warning, it may be to help us discover that the world cannot survive either unless we begin to re-envision it as sacred.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It's one of the most fundamental and universal forces in the world.But not in this film. Zhenya openly regrets not having aborted her son, who is now 12 years old, and her husband Boris agrees that an abortion would have been better for everyone. This unhappy family is finally falling apart: Zhenya and Boris are getting a divorce and are considering a boarding school for their son. Both hope to find happiness with new partners, and clearly they don't want the boy to interfere.This situation takes an unexpected twist when the son doesn't turn up at home after school. Reluctantly, the parents inform the police about the missing child. A volunteer corps starts a search of the neighbourhood. Even after the boy's computer is inspected, his best friend has revealed their secret hideaway, and his grandmother has been visited for possible clues, the boy is not found.The search for the boy puts Boris and Zhenya in a ambivalent situation: they are supposed to be heartbroken, but in reality they consider the disappearance of their son as a rather fortunate event. On their minds are their respective new partners, more than the whereabouts of the boy.Just leave it to director Andrey Zvyagintsev to turn this situation into an excellent, but pitch black drama without even the least shimmer of hope. The hate between Boris and Zhenya is extremely intense, and the rest of the cast doesn't show much human warmth either. On countless occasions, the characters check the screen of their smartphone. When nobody exchanges a smile or a kind word, digital friendships are better than nothing. The last scenes are the most desperate: even with their new partners, Boris and Zhenya don't seem to find any happiness.Surprisingly, Zvyangintsev doesn't use any urban decay or Russian dreariness to accentuate the general negativism. On the contrary, Moscow looks modern and many scenes could just as well have been set in an American or European city.Apart from the drama of a family falling apart, the film has something to say about Russia. There are news flashes about the war with Ukraine, and a police officer complains about not having enough resources to fight all the crime that's going on. The ultimate metaphorical statement is in the very last scene: Zhenya is running on a treadmill, wearing a training jacket with 'Russia' on it - not even in Cyrillic letters.

This gesture starts the story of Alyosha and his parents Boris and Zhenya, a family in the middle of divorce process. The latest movie of Russian director Andrei Zvyagintsev Loveless (Nelubov') is a drama film that will show us a multi layered and rich in its senses story.At the very beginning of the film we witness a verbally brutal quarrel between the spouses in which each of them try to avoid to keep the son. Both have already new partners and look forward to finally get rid of all disturbing for their future happy life circumstances. While parents assume Alyosha is sleeping or, what is more likely, they don't care at all about if he can hear them, we see the boy hiding behind the door and silently bursting out in tears. Here is one of two most emotional peaks of the film. The two traumatic and heartbreaking climaxes (the second one at the end of the film) both include the boy, and it could be supposed that his figure is not only the trigger of the story but also something more like a core of the ideas represented in the movie. Born in 2000, disappeared in 2012 (both dates are connected with elections in Russia), wearing the red jacket (the colour of love) on the search photo and leaving the blue one (the colour of devotion and honesty) as the only detail they found from him after his disappearance, the character of Alyosha frames and seems to embody the changing atmosphere in society. Significantly, red and blue colours turn at the end into the white-blue-red training suit of Zhenya while she running on treadmill at the balcony of her luxurious new flat. The caption 'Russia' decorates her sweatsuit and, without a doubt, highlights one of the most easy-to-grasp metaphors, that director wanted to present his vision with.Andrei Zvyagintsev puts an emphasis on details, often symbolic ones, and use them as a tool to transmit his personal views and comments on society. Loveless is full of tiny codes that the viewer could decipher according to his experience as well as origin. Zvyagintsev skilfully plays with stereotypes of contemporaneity such as family, success, politics and the national identity, and it would be too narrow to connect it only with Russian society. Often rough and too straightforward, the director steady prosects the world of the characters in conjunction with the atmosphere they live in, but, first of all, according to director's opinion, despite the desire of the viewer to believe without a doubt in it all is very strong. The environment of characters is supported on the background with carefully chosen bits of authentic TV and radio programs that reflect the current political and sociocultural state, the accidental small talks of other heroes in the movies work the same way.In Loveless the viewer sometimes could find him-/herself wondering that the heroes and their reality are often binary. The ordinary conflict of a man and a woman, the desire to be happy and the unhappy reality, the stagnating bureaucracy of the police and prompt response of the volunteers searching for Alyosha, almost no shades in between. The end of the movie eliminates even this scarce diversity, bringing the director's relentless conclusion about contemporary human soul to its totality. Common knowledge, that at its best could be characterised by Leo Tolstoy phrase that 'happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way' in this movie doesn't work. In their new 'happy' families Boris and Zhenya are equally lost, apathetic and even speechless.

A rough estimate: somewhere between twenty and thirty. Sometimes there are two or three mirror scenes in a time span of just a few minutes. A few of them really stand out in a cinematographic way. In one scene, we see a conversation between two people, but it seems as if they are talking to each other's mirror image: they are never shown talking directly to each other.The symbolism of it all is clear. In 'L'Amant Double', lead character Chlo\u00e9 is in love with twin brothers. At least, that's what she thinks. And that's what we think. Unless the twins are really two sides of the same personality. But two sides of which personality exactly? His, or a projection of hers? What is real, what is imagined? Director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon plays the game of mirrors perfectly, and keeps it up until the very end. When you think it's all clear, there are still some strange things. Which one of the twin brothers was the smoker again? The film is very stylish. Ozon has made the most of the locations. In the museum where Chlo\u00e9 works as a guard, outrageous art is being exposed. It's a perfect backdrop for some visually beautiful scenes. The clothing, the hairdo's, the furniture: everything is done in the best of Parisian tastes.There's much to enjoy in 'L'Amant Double', for different kinds of moviegoers. It is a thriller of some sorts, with the suspense building up until the last few minutes. It's also a psychological drama, with lots of twists and turns. And in the very end, there's even a little bit of horror.

Both movies deal with issues of identity, truth and deception and how these can impact relationships between men and women. This is were similarities stop. There are many differences and almost all in favor of the 2016 film.The story which is 'freely' inspired by a novel by Joyce Carol Oates (which has already originated a movie by David Cronenberg) starts as the story about a relationship between a psychoanalyst and his patient that turns into a strange and uneasy love affair. While the relation between shrink and patient needs to be based on trust and truth, in this case the contrary happens, as each of the two characters avoids fully sharing their feelings, hides things from the past, speaks half truths or plain lies. They seem that they cannot work as a couple on any plan. The bad start of the relation develops to worse and the odd things that happen on screen are complicated by having them told in a mix of genres - French art film with Paris and a museum of disturbing modern art as background, erotic thriller, horror and guilt in the Hitchcock and Polanski traditions. All these get together in a 'bouillion' that becomes less and less credible, up to the point that the story cannot be solved but by explaining that all was some kind of dementia delirium with very prosaic physiological roots. What should have been a sophisticated game of mirrors becomes a multiplication of images by mirrors disposed in a chaotic manner. To make things worse, the ending makes the mistake of explaining too much in sordid details. Hard to believe that the film with this ending comes in the filmography of Ozon just after \"Frantz\" with the wonderful ambiguity of its open ending.Acting is also problematic. Ozon's choice of actors seems sometimes odd (not only here) because they are characters that do not feel well in their own skins. In this case he chose Marine Vacth (his discovery in \"Young & Beautiful \") for a role that needs more expressiveness and fragility than what the actress delivered on screen. There is no chemistry between her and either of the two selves (or twin brothers) played by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier . I will never complain about seeing again Jacqueline Bisset in a film and I appreciate Ozon's creating in every film of his strong and interesting feminine characters that break the stereotypes, but her role or maybe roles (another odd double) seem to be wasted talent here.\"The Double Lover\" never reaches at cinematographic level its ambitions.

So step forward British auteur Sally\u00a0Potter.Having been appointed Shadow Minister for Health, Janet (Kristen Scott Thomas) and her husband Bill (Timothy Spall) throw a celebratory dinner party for their friends: the acerbic April (Patricia\u00a0Clarkson) and (played by Bruno\u00a0Ganz) her new age partner Gottfried (\"prick an aromatherapist and you'll find a fascist\" says April); lesbian professor Martha and her 'Masterchef' runner-up partner Jinny (Emily\u00a0Mortimer), who is carrying their purchased foetuses (\"babies are born every day, in large numbers - large enough to put our planet at risk\" is April's unsentimental but accurate comment). Banker Tom (Cillian\u00a0Murphy) arrives with his wife's apologies: she will be along later. Thus the stage is set, but when a champagne cork shatters a window it is an omen that this will be a dinner party none of the attendees will soon forget.Trendy lefties who spend too much time thinking are an open goal when it comes to comedy, with their talk of 'post-post-feminism' and their professorships in Utopian Americanism, and Potter does not miss the target in her - I suspect affectionate - mickey-taking. There is nothing original in this - not even the 'twist' at the end - but the film is so entertaining that does not matter (with one exception: when banker Tom heads to the bathroom to snort cocaine I rolled my eyes - just once I would like to see a fictional young banker who *does not* have a coke habit: don't any of them simply put the kettle on?)There is good acting all around: Clarkson gets all the best lines - albeit at the expense of depth of character - but that merely makes the others work harder with the lines they have been given. Thomas, whose character is the most fully-formed, is noteworthy.At just over seventy minutes this is rather a short film. Quite why Potter decided to make it in black-and-white I do not know - extra filmsnob points I suppose. But it is hugely entertaining and I look forward to seeing it again.

It just goes to show that one should never be taken in by a slickly made trailer or a stellar cast-list. What a disappointing load of old codswallop.Script: abysmal. No attempt made to write anything approaching natural conversation. Dialogue was jagged and disjointed, lacking any genuine motivational flow. Sorry, but real people just DON'T interact like this. And as for it being a comedy, well you could have fooled me. I think I laughed three times, and two of them were little more than polite titters.Pacing: what pacing? Whole scads of dialogue slouched by like a line of blinded soldiers. At one point I caught myself yawning.Characterisation: seven characters flapping about on screen and not a single one of them believable: just 2-dimensional assemblages of histrionics. Consequently I never felt any sympathy (or even antipathy) toward any of them, so couldn't engage with any of the supposed crises they were experiencing.Performances: almost uniformly muggy and overdone - an effect made even worse by the habit of shooting an awful lot of exchanges in tight close-up.I was left with the feeling that this might just work on stage (where you'd lose all the tight close-up nonsense) as a short, one-act dark farce. Why on earth anyone thought it would succeed as a movie is beyond me.Oh yes... I said \"short\", didn't I? When the end credits appeared there was an audible \"Uh?\" of surprise from the audience. Surely an entire movie hadn't passed already? On exiting the cinema I checked the time. The film had lasted barely over an hour.

The really good script lines are dispersed among the excellent cast, although I do have a weakness for the role of Timothy Spall, such a great and modest actor, gripping the movie from the start onwards.Why not rate this higher? I think it lacks a really great ambition, it is a nice ensemble piece, but despite the good things feels somewhat empty, more entertainment than art.

However, it is in the mostly quiet yet compelling chemistry concocted between Mamet and Shear that we find a fresh, frank and funny take on a tale as old as the one of that original conflicted couple, Adam and Eve.While mostly a yarn of the young 'uns, a special shout out simply must go to the nearly effortless and totally natural work of the entire ensemble of \"the old guard\" in \"The Boy Downstairs\". Veteran actress Deirdre O'Connell (\"Hulu's \"The Path\") in particular radiates as a widower who serves both as landlord and confidante to damsel in distress Diana. You may wanna be hip to the fact that at times some of the dialogue and dynamics come off as a bit contrived here. And Writer/Director Sophie Brooks's stylistic choice to shift scenes back and forth in time can be flat-out befuddling.These points notwithstanding, you'll likely find yourself content to overlook such potential distraction as you focus on the fine performances of Mamet and Shear in \"The Boy Downstairs\".

I haven't really seen much of Mark Pellington's work outside of The Mothman Prophecies (which I liked quite a bit). Main reason for wanting to check this film out was the fact that the film employs a really talented cast. I'm always a fan of Jon Hamm getting more roles in film as he is a great actor. This film was tedious, slow, and a failed attempt at an interesting idea.This film links a few stories and characters together through a common thread of loss, love, and memories from objects. We start off by seeing an insurance agent and eventually his story links with another character who in turn links with a different one for segments of different stories. I like the idea quite a bit and I've seen this type of storytelling work in the past, but this film can't utilize this method with success. Its a dull affair.The cast is great as expected, especially Catherine Keener in a nice standout role. The characters don't carry any weight and its easy to lose track of one's story as its just boring and bland. You sit there thinking that nothing even goes on. This is okay if there's some sort of style or intriguing dialogue that adds to the story, but none of that happens here. Near the end I was just hoping for it to end.There may be few who will find this film to be a moving experience but for me its a film that tries to hard to be spiritual and emotional while never leaving first gear. I see what is being attempted but the film has no weight to its characters or their turmoils.

{"imdbId": "tt6456222", "movieTitle": "Nostalgia", "title": "Well-acted but overly episodic treatment of unsual subject", "author": "lor_", "postedDate": "12 February 2018", "reviewContent": "Casting Jon Hamm, with his \"Mad Men\" iconic persona adding much to the role, in \"Nostalgia\" was the best decision made by the movie's writer and director. Otherwise, they seem to have fumbled the ball.This morbid look at how people become attached to the objects accumulated in a \"life lived\" to quote the show's most moving term is loaded with arbitrary and contrived connections that attempt to link individual story vignettes into a cohesive whole. With the absence of action, which is what moving pictures are really all about (I learned that early in my formative movie buff years watching foreign films from around the globe without English subtitles as a crutch), we are left with a cold, gloomy movie.First half is quite promising, with an unusual central character played by John Ortiz. He's an insurance investigator, visiting people either inheriting a home or possessions or those in a position to bequeath same. He doesn't appraise but checks out the scene and gives advice on getting an appraiser for example. And he's about as welcome as a coffin-maker in a Western doing body measurements on somebody before they go out to have a gunfight.Ortiz' character reminded me of Marvin Miller in \"The Millionaire\" TV series, one of my favorites as a kid growing up in the '50s. Miller would give a check for a million bucks made out by the enigmatic (never shown) J. Beresford Tipton to a seemingly random person, and we in TV land would watch for half an hour how the moolah would change that person's life.Opening scene elegantly establishes the movie's main theme, as Ortiz sits in a diner admiring waitress Shinelle Azoroh's necklace, which she reveals is a treasured family heirloom. He goes to the home of Bruce Dern to check out his lifelong accumulation of stuff, and octogenarian Bruce is cavalier about the importance or value of it, clearly not wishing to play Ortiz's game. We see that Bruce has an estranged pregnant daughter who doesn't care about him, and the film suffers from our not finding out anything about Dern's character, other than gazing at various photos of the actor in his youth, circa his screen breakthrough so long ago in Hitchcock's \"Marnie\". Next up Ortiz interviews Ellen Burstyn amid the ashes of her burnt-out home. She survived a fire but only had time to save some jewelry and a baseball (signed by Ted Williams, hint, hint) that her late husband treasured. She's now living with her kid and mate, and clearly they feel she's just a burden to them, so she heads to Las Vegas to have the ball appraised. At this point Ortiz disappears from the movie, never to return, and I missed him as potentially the central character and unifying force.Burstyn's expert acting makes her vignette work dramatically, but she too is given short shrift as we meet Jon Hamm, running a sports memorabila store (and expert in the field), who informs her in cliched Antiques Roadshow fashion that the ball is worth perhaps $80,000 to $100,000. Ellen was never directly attached to it, now only treasuring it as a connection to her late husband, so she sells it to him. No matter that it is clear Hamm is cheating her to some extent (could be worth a million bucks perhaps?), he takes over the movie from here to fadeout.SPOILER:Not to be outdone, Catherine Keener as Hamm's older sister provides the emotional punch in the later reels, where a contrived plot twist has Hamm moving from uninvolved spectator (a la the Ortiz role early on) to \"shoe is on the other foot\" deeply involved protagonist when tragedy strikes his family on cue. Writer Alex Ross Perry and director Mark Pellington (whose thriller \"Arlington Road\" packed the wallop missing from \"Nostalgia\") key the show to objects and artifacts, but as a lifelong collector (from baseball cards, to philately, to ultimately valuable Jazz LPs) I found this morbid approach to be off-point. One can be nostalgic over the ephemeral, namely memories just as mine of \"The Millionaire\" came rushing back without material objects to prompt them. Similarly, for all the assiduous accumulation of Jazz albums over the years, it is the memory of the artists performing live, and getting to meet and even interview them, that linger with me rather than the collection itself - Hamm in the attic examining Rollins and Coltrane LPs left there by his dad drove home that point specifically. Even if the auteurs are ultimately arguing (it's questionable given the emphasis on loss, as in a key scene comparing the ephemeral nature of photos stored in the Cloud via smart phone and lost, compared to tangible and treasured snapshots retained the old-fashioned way) the obvious point of memories of a life lived being so much more important than mere talismans of same, the movie fails to deliver that message forcefully.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Normally there would be...(whirr of calculator) um, yes, approximately none. \n Here we start with a citizen's suicide in the underground, another one reported soon after, then climactically two failed attempts. One is by the beautiful young niece, the other by the mousey middle-aged heroine. And the son of the man who saves her killed himself too. Oy Lucy. Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn this ain't. The suicides punctuate a panorama of lives lived and wasted in quiet desperation. \n The film's title and trailer carried not an inkling of the darkness in this \"love story.\" A repressed Tokyo office worker discovers her wild side when she falls for her young American English teacher and follows him out to sunny California. From the moment she adopts her new American name of Lucy and dons the crazy Harpo blonde wig, love and hilarity ensue. Spoiler alert: Nope.\n The clues come early. Our first view of \"Lucy\" is behind the white face-mask that connotes fear of infection, fear of contamination, fear of life. She witnesses the first subway suicide and hears about the second. She's uncomfortable and cramped in her office job, a room of exposed desks, where even her eventual humiliation plays out in public. \n Her stunted emotional life dates back to her first love, whom her sister stole and married. Lucy's sex with Tom avenges that, though at her niece's emotional expense as well as Lucy's sister's. \n It's hard to sympathize with Lucy. She's duped by her flighty niece into (over)paying for the English lessons. After tutor John departs, the dashed Lucy explodes at her colleague's retirement party, brutally and pointlessly exposing the sham sentiments of the occasion. \n Our glimpses of Lucy's apartment are of a chaotic mess of random and lurid junk, an emblem of her own doomed dream life perhaps. Liberated from Japanese restraints, in America her sexual predation deepens her indecorum and delusion. \n Indeed no-one here is wholly sympathetic. The dashing hugger John may come on as the fresh American spirit but he proves a jerk too. He abandoned his wife and daughter for the adventure in Japan, then abdicated his responsibilities to chase his latest fancy. If he indeed did quit a teaching job at Stanford, then he stands with Lucy, the niece, her mother, another example of people who make disastrous life choices.\n A fringe character provides the only stability. English student \"Tom\" embraces John's compulsion to embrace but proves to live that emotional, human commitment. The goofy prosaic Japanese man proves the saviour Lucy craved to find in the dashing American. \n After Tom saves Lucy the film closes on the note off their romantic promise. But it's in the underground, where the suicides happen. And it took his son's suicide to snap Tom into recognition of bis need for human intimacy. It may start with John's sham friendliness but in Tom it blossoms into a true connection.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Setsuko witnesses the suicide on the way to the office and her dull routine. She is middle-aged, lonely and unhappy. Perhaps she could snap like this. When Setsuko receives an invitation from her niece Mika to attend advanced English lessons, the classes provide unexpected light and warmth in her life.

Setsuko goes in search of him across an ocean, and goes even farther within herself.Combining humor with seriousness and sincerity, the film reveals the wonders of what travel can do. It takes us outside ourselves and reveals truths that would not have been revealed if we stayed in our bubbles. It shows us our strengths and weaknesses, the good and bad. The film also shows that the difference between Japan and America goes beyond language. The Japanese are generally not as outgoing as Americans. There is not much in the way of touching or hugs. The Japanese are good at wearing masks. People like Setsuko go unnoticed and suicide is a big problem. It is wonderful that the director is giving a voice to those like Setsuko.

She hardly verbalizes her emotions yet you could almost feel her character tugging wildly at your heartstrings. Lucy's naivety and a certain aura of innocence is captured so profoundly in Shinobu Terajima's plausible performance. The stellar cast as a whole delivers a sincere and heartfelt performance, complimenting each others conflicting personalities so effortlessly despite the language barrier. It was intriguing to see how diverse cultural differences have the potential to influence and ignite our latent desires for better or for worse. In the case of Setsuko, her humdrum life as a singleton middle aged Japanese office worker, turns giddy high when she stumbles upon John (Josh Hartnett), an unconventional English teacher from the US in the most unexpected of circumstances. His quirky techniques of teaching English which incorporates the need for her to take on a more liberal persona as Lucy, propels Setsuko to dare to delve deeper into her being and scratch the core to unveil an audacious side of her which will excite and overwhelm her beyond what she could possibly fathom. A side that leaves you questioning who she really is. Hailing from a conservative society, her sudden sense of liberation is hard to ignore when the plot quickly escalates and you find Lucy shedding her inhibitions recklessly in the US. She throws caution to the wind in her dealings with John and unabashedly proclaims that she is in love with him. But somehow you cant help but wonder if she genuinely feels for John or perhaps she is just wildly in love with her newfound freedom and persona which is tagged to John, as he is ultimately the catalyst that set her off on this journey of self discovery. Peppered with unexpected events, messy family feuds and raw human connections, the film slowly unravels the tainted sides of the key characters which somewhat serves to showcase the imperfections and complexities of life. When Lucy finally comes to her senses and finds herself in a boulevard of broken dreams and unrequited love, her character reveals a more vulnerable side of her once again which was what first captured our hearts in the beginning. We are reminded she is essentially only human and still deserving of empathy, despite her onslaught of arbitrary decisions that led to her downfall.A glimmer of hope comes in the form of Tom, an endearing saviour who leaves us feeling hopeful for Lucy and her shot at true love. Overall a film that succeeded in capturing an honest glimpse of human connections without romanticizing life, with a bold take on cultural differences sans being stereotypical or condescending that left me with a comforting reminder of hope when the odds are stacked against us.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The beginning, in particular, seemed very strange and quirky. However, this is NOT the mood of the entire picture and the cute leading character progressively becomes uglier as the story progresses.When the story begins, Setsuko is conned into buying an English language course off her niece. The niece says she paid for it but it would be a big favor if the aunt paid her for the classes and took them herself. And, considering Setsuko is single and hasn't much of a life, she decides to at least try the classes. She is shocked at what the classes were. Instead of a nice classroom, the place looked like a sex club and the instructor, John, was more about teaching the students how to not only sound American but ACT American. His class included hugging (something VERY foreign to Japanese society), wearing wigs and acting casual...and Setsuko liked this as well as her new American name, Lucy.Soon, however, Lucy learns it's been a set-up. Her niece only wanted the money to run off to America with John...and the new teacher is too normal and doesn't give hugs. So, she does what anyone would do in this situation...she insults her coworkers and gets a plane ticket to America. When her nasty sister finds out, she insists she comes along. What's next? Well it's NOT what I expected as the cute Lucy reveals herself to be a selfish, nasty piece of work. In fact, most everyone in the film seems this way-- at least all the main characters. All semblance to a comedy disappears and what you're left with is the story of a woman you find almost impossible to like.

{"imdbId": "tt5584796", "movieTitle": "Tehran Taboo", "title": "Life in Iran at its most despicable", "author": "Horst in Translation (filmreviews@web.de)", "postedDate": "27 November 2017", "reviewContent": "\"Tehran Taboo\" is an Austrian/German co-production from this year (2017) and this is the most known career effort so far by writer and director Ali Soozandeh. Given the subject, I am not surprised at all that this film that runs for slightly over 1.5 hours has managed to score some awards attention already, also in Cannes. This is about life in the Iranian capital of Tehran in the present and it's a really dark and shocking depiction. Oh yeah, I also need to say that this movie is animated from start to finish. The focus here is on a group of people and their (not so) every day life. We have a mother working as a prostitute who tries to get his mute son a normal life, but obstacles from school and authorities make it hard for her. We have a pregnant woman whose man cheats on her and who has had several miscarriages already. We have an aspiring musician who takes a girl's virginity and tries his best to make it possible for her to have an operation that won't let her fianc\u00e9 find out about what happened.One of the film's strengths is that it does really well in terms of shades. Even as these characters I just described may be ahead of their country's limited progress in terms of equality, they still are far from perfect. That phone joke basically costs the innocent woman her life. The young guy made the girl drunk, drugged her even. The girl lied about the real reason for the operation. Even the little boy causes severe damage by telling the old man where to find the candy. They may not be rotten or evil or anything, but they are all far from angels. The bearded man is the best example of how the country keeps the progressive ones on the leash. He gives the woman the apartment, he gives her some money, but he also does not give her the documents/signatures she needs although it is his job to do so. And in the end what he does to her is close to rape showing us that he will always be the one in charge. That's a nice metaphor and the film has others too that work pretty well like the recurring themes of the lights up there that are explained in the final scene or the kittens or the photographer etc. From that perspective, the movie really has a lot to offer.Overall, it is definitely among the best animated films I have seen from 2017. Unsurprisingly though, it will not be a contender at the Oscars in the Animated Feature category. A bit of a shame as I could have seen it make some waves. Of course with all the violence and sex, it is an animated film exclusively for grown-ups (not an adult film though obviously). I am not surprised the director worked on The Green Wave as an animator. To me the film seemed a bit similar to Waltz with Bashir in terms of the overall contents, but also in terms of the atmosphere, even if war does not really play a big role in here. Finally, to end the review on a positive note, I would like to say that the ways in which the younger generation is depicted here offers room for hope that things could turn better in the next 50 years. We'll see if they will. Still its depiction of brutal reality would get the movie banned within an instant in Iran I am sure. It's a very depressing watch and it should also have us question the dominant religion and its approach to female rights in particular. They are treated worse than animals frequently to be honest and we should keep that in mind the next time we complain about sexism here in the Western World. Over there is where things are really rotten. But I am not surprised that Soozandeh did not make faith a crucial component of this film. It fits in well with the general approach these days when it comes to looking away and over-the-top tolerance. Anyway, enough of that. I recommend the watch of course. This was a very intelligent and important movie. If you like stuff like the aforementioned Walth with Bashir or Panahi's Taxi, then see this one here too.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt6466464", "movieTitle": "The Monkey King 3", "title": "Less an action fantasy than a fantasy romance, this third chapter of Soi Cheang's 'Monkey King' franchise sidelines its titular character as well as the mismatched travelling", "author": "moviexclusive", "postedDate": "14 February 2018", "reviewContent": "Though Stephen Chow's 'Journey to the West' series has been the more buzzed-about one in the last few years, director Soi Cheang has been studiously building up his own 'Monkey King' franchise. The first chapter, which boasted a spirited turn by Donnie Yen as the titular Wukong who defied Chow Yun Fat's Jade Emperor, was nonetheless a huge disappointment because of its stilted storytelling and laughable CGI; but the sequel, which saw Aaron Kwok take over the golden staff (pun intended) with a more low-key but also more nuanced performance, was a marked improvement that benefited generously from Gong Li's devilish turn as the White Bone Demon. Not surprisingly, Kwok has agreed to reprise his role in this third chapter, although this time round he's been reduced to no more than a supporting act.Whereas most, if not all, 'Monkey King' films have played on the dynamic between Wukong and his master Xuanzang, Cheang and his writer Wen Ning have placed the focus this time on Xuanzang (Feng Shaofeng) alone. Stumbling upon a kingdom populated only by women after an encounter with an unfriendly River God (revealed later on to be a vengeful god played by Lin Chi-ling), Xuanzang falls in love with its Queen (Zhao Liying), thereby presenting him with an apparent conundrum whether to forsake his religious calling to love all mankind. But perhaps more crucially, Xuanzang and his companions - Wukong, the pig demon Bajie (Xiao Shenyang), and the blue-skinned sand demon Wujing (Him Lo) - have to first escape execution directed by the kingdom's Empress Dowager-like Madam Perceptor (Gigi Leung), who is adamant that men are the worst poison to their kind. Alas their attempt to escape is thwarted by an invisible, magical net around Womanland, though it's not difficult to guess that the key to penetrating the spell is none other than true love itself. It's also not difficult to guess that Xuanzang and the Queen will eventually discover that secret by their love for each other - a love that will quite literally see them 'through the sun and rain', as the couple are banished from the kingdom and forced to endure both elements in a wooden boat out at sea. Besides testing the mettle of their relationship, the voyage will also clarify Xuanzang's choice between the love of one (wo)man or the love of all sentient beings; although his decision should be obvious to most viewers, since it will take a lot of gumption for this movie to attempt a completely revisionist take on Wu Cheng'en's classic, and you can probably guess that it isn't nearly that bold. To his credit, Cheang does undertake some brave moves for a Mainland-centric film. For one, its notion of a female-only land seen against China's male chauvinistic society is progressive to say the least, especially given its people's extremely dim and fatalistic view of the male gender. For another, it handles the subject of abortion with a certain cavalier, and some would say careless attitude - after his companions accidentally drink from a fertility spring known as the Motherhood River, Wukong approaches a cross-dressing hermit in the Miscarriage Cave to obtain its tears to terminate the unwanted pregnancies. And for yet another, it depicts an unrequited lesbian romance between a mortal and an androgynous spirit that at its most audacious has a scene with Gigi Leung and Lin Chi-ling locking lips.But perhaps its most audacious choice is to attempt a genre switch in this third chapter that turns what used to be an action fantasy into a fantasy romance. Oh yes, if it isn't obvious by now, there are hardly any epic battle scenes to speak of; in fact, there are just two - one in the middle with two big scorpions, and the other right at the end with the bitter River God threatening to drown the entire Womanland. Whereas its predecessors took pride in crediting Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung as action directors, there is no one explicitly mentioned in that role here, which is just as well given how underwhelming these two sequences play out. Diminishing the amount of action in the film also further reduces Wukong's significance - after all, he is Xuanzang's bodyguard - and gives Kwok even less to do, and the same can be said of Bajie and Wujing too.That is ultimately a pity, because these unlikely travel buddies have established quite some chemistry. Indeed, two of the most amusing scenes in the movie are thanks to their witty banter - the very opening scene that sees them making their way down a gentle river (before being rudely interrupted by the aforementioned River God) sees some funny back-and-forth about who had taken away Wukong's pants while he was bathing; and their very first attempted escape from lock-up in Womanland, as well as their subsequent interrogation, is a riotous hoot what with Wukong's impudence, Bajie's flirtatiousness and Wujing's masculinity on full display. Tempering cheekiness with conscience, Kwok has also revealed himself to be quite a fine Wukong, and sidelining his character here inadvertently makes the film much duller.While it is understandable why Cheang has decided to make this third chapter tonally different from the earlier two, 'The Monkey King 3' is a lot less entertaining as a result. Its philosophical musings about true love are not quite so insightful, but more crucially, it hardly gives its more charismatic performers enough screen time. It may have seemed a timely choice given the momentum and publicity that the female empowerment movement has gathered of late to adapt the quartet's misadventures in Womanland for this movie, but in the grander scheme of their 'Journey to the West', this is at best an interesting sidenote and at worst an unnecessary detour. The ending hints at a fourth instalment set to tell the more well-known Fiery Mountain episode - and on hindsight, the franchise should probably have simply gone straight there than bothered to stop over here.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt6466464", "movieTitle": "The Monkey King 3", "title": "Such a great film with awesome video effects.", "author": "silvermistvio", "postedDate": "19 March 2018", "reviewContent": "Xi You Ji : Nu Er Guo is such a great film. Not only video effects are good, but also the actors and actresses' performances too. Some people are saying this is a bad film because they don't know some facts, especially the original story of this. I'll explain one by one.1) Nu Er Guo (in English, The Kingdom of Women) has ONLY women in it's kingdom and the citizens don't know about men and they can't even go out from the Kingdom. So, they don't know some things, such as Tang Sang is a monk, and monk can't love anyone, etc. The Queen lives in her kingdom since the day she was born and men are banned in the kingdom. So, she hasn't meet with a man until Tang Sang showed up. And Tang Sang was the first man she ever saw in her life. That's why she fell in love with her. If there were such things as \"love at the first sight\", then why would it possible that the Queen fell in love with a monk? The concept is the same. She fell in love at the first sight.As for Tang Sang, even though he knows being a monk doesn't allow falling in love. But that is also acceptable. Let me tell you a story. But I want to say in advance that my English isn't that much good, so, maybe I can't illustrate the whole picture. But I'll try as much as I can. In my country, there was a legend. Legend says there are some monks with the ability to fly in the air. Of course those monks practiced too long, so that they get that kind of ability. But one day, a monk saw a girl. The girl was so pretty, so, he fell in love with her immediately. As soon as he saw and fell in love with her, the monk lost that ability instantly and he fall from the sky (because he saw that girl while flying in the sky). A monk is also a human. Being a human, he could love especially if the girl is pretty. That is something every human can't escape from. The same logic applies here. Tang Sang may fall in love with that Queen too. That's why there is a love story between Tang Sang and the queen which is acceptable.2) The casting. The casting was very good. I feel like all actors and actresses are in right place. Hence, their performances are very good, especially, Zhao Liying. I totally love her.3) Sound editing and mixing, which is, I think, no need to mention at all. Every background sound they used in this film is so perfect. I can feel that it's really happening.4) Visual effects. The visual effects are great. I don't see that much good in visual effects in Chinese films. I watch a lot of films including American, British and Chinese, the visual effects I like are from American and British films. I even saw that very bad films that let you know it's a visual effect and it's not real, etc. A visual effect that is no neat. But those effects in this film is so perfect, especially, they are being chased by that river immortal on the river. They will never shoot that scene in a river just like in the film. Plus, that one is not even real. So, they all are visual effects. And the last scene, it's one of the coolest visual effects used in the film.5) Photography/Cinematography. I don't know the sceneries are real or not. But they are very beautiful. I really wanted to go there when I saw those scenes. So, I'd say director of photography and/or cinematographer is very good. Beautiful sceneries are very important for a film. This one has it all.6) The original story which was animation that I watched when I was young was just 60 minutes (tops) long. But in this film, they put some extra things to make the film 2 hours long. Although they have stretched the plot a little bit, but it turned out good. There's no boring scene, and some scenes are even funny. It's very important to entertain audience with some jokes. But if there are too much jokes, it's not good too. In this film, of course they put some jokes, but it didn't make the film stupid, bad one or whatever. It made the film more enjoyable. And also I laughed a lot. Laughing prolongs your life. Thanks to the screen play writer.7) OST. Although this film doesn't have many songs like Fifty Shades Freed film had, the OSTs are very good. I've listened those two songs before the movie was released. I totally loved it. When I heard again in the film, because it was in the right place, I loved it more. The songs are really in the right place and it makes the film better. I'd say because of those OSTs, the film becomes better and better.8) The story. In the love story of Tang Sang and the Queen, the Queen stayed at Tang Sang's side and wrote on the ground together with him when he lost his child because Wukong gave him the liquid to lose his pregnancy. That scene with the lovely song is very touchable. I'm really and totally touched. And also when the Queen let them go, because of the performances of actors and actresses', I'm touched by that scene too. As for me, those two scenes are the best scenes in the whole film.Because of those facts I've stated in above, I'd say this is a good film to watch. Although I don't know why these films get very low rating and why people are giving Asian films (especially Chinese films) with visual effects, as for me, those ones are pretty good. A few days ago, I watched a Taiwanese film because it has high rating 7.0 here on IMDB which was very rare to see. I found the story was quite impressive. That, I accept. What I don't accept is a bit drama and it also includes kissing and sex scenes. IMDB users or audiences only give high votes if only they are dramas and kissing and sex scenes are included in the films, just like Shape of Water and/or Blade Runner 2049? As for me, the visual effects used in Blade Runner is nothing compared to this film. I haven't a clue of why people are giving high votes to those drama-like Sci-Fi/Fiction/Fantasy/Adventure films? Those ones are terribly boring. For instance, Blade Runner 2049. I don't even know the plot is. The plot was all about the leading character was moving around and nothing much happened. And then, hours went by and the movie was finished. So, compared to Blade Runner 2049, this one is way better. If Blade Runner 2049 gets high votes, this one deserves 10 out of 10 votes. No offense, okie?All in all, as for me, it's a great movie with awesome visual effects. I didn't even know 2 hours time was passed. It's so enjoyable. Even if this one is not your taste, it should at least make a fine film.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

What can I say? I was truly blown away by this movie. Winner of the Noburo Ofuji award (the most prestigious award in Japan for an animated film), this film has unfortunately only had a very limited release in Japan (although it is playing in theaters again since winning the award). The director, Masaaki Yuasa, has previously done critically acclaimed animation work on other series, and helped create the equally mind-blowing, and somewhat disturbing short animated movie \"Cat Soup\".The first thing about the movie to note is the animation. The animators worked in a collaborative effort, and included a wide range of experimental and traditional animation techniques, a bit of CGI, and even a bit of live action. Viewed as individual pieces, it can be jarring, but seen together as a whole, each piece seems to fit with each other perfectly, with the different animation forms setting the mood perfectly.The story begins in present-day Tokyo, and follows a loser who is letting his childhood girlfriend slip away. Things take a twist to the fantastical side, as the characters embark on a surreal journey that changes everything about them. The actual elements of the plot are not really the focus of the movie..it is about setting the mood, creating the atmosphere of the characters' emotions, and drawing the viewer in to same mental journey the characters are going on, without even realizing it. The pace of the movie picks up and slows in parts, before building up to its thunderous and (literally) exhausting climax.See this movie , if only for the virtuoso animation that you will not see in any other film.

As an avid follower of experimental cinema and anime I rarely get rewarded with solidly evolving features, but once in a while I strike gold and get to travel through the medium of rich expressionism dealing with both real life and fictional events in the utmost fascinating fashion. Mind Game is the recent treasure and a great example of such artistry, fusing stories of love, self worth and other qualities of life, without forcing conclusions or values, but merely giving you a chance to reflect on your life or simply enjoy that of the characters.The main conflict of this film deals with a young man named Nishi, who lacks courage to do what he really wants in life. After a rather fatal turn of events he gets a second chance at life and love. So he embarks on a journey to face things he otherwise wouldn't, but his personal rediscovery takes place in the weirdest of places. Aside from feeling a genuinely exalting rush with its almost mosaic imagery and perfectly fitting music, I felt something else while viewing Mind Game and I attained a certain notion afterwards, which I don't see worth sharing, since I believe everyone who'll give this a watch will acquire on their own terms, levels and depth.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The man is Meinhard (Meinhard Neumann), in Bulgaria to work on a hydroelectric power station close to the village. He could be Alan Ladd or John Wayne, transported across miles and years to Eastern Europe to conquer the natives, except here the natives are family-oriented local residents who do not carry tomahawks. Alienated by their unfamiliar surroundings, the workers hang the German flag in their camp and mock the local residents whose language they do not understand.One says, \"Everything's messed up here. It's just like traveling through time, going back to the past.\" Grisebach says that, \"It's very interesting when you have the chance to have empathy, but you instead have contempt, or a conflict, instead of identifying yourself with the other one.\" We can sense that a clash of cultures is inevitable, but we do not know in what direction it will go. Remembering the German occupation of their country during the war, the townspeople themselves are not eager to offer any welcome. Grisebach contrasts the uber-masculine posturing of the construction workers at the camp with the warm family gatherings in the town. With no musical score, the film builds suspense through silences and facial expressions that tell us what words cannot.Meinhard is treated with disdain by the work crew boss Vincent (Reinhardt Wetrek), who exacerbates tension with the locals by flirting with a young woman out for a swim, an incident that borders on harassment. Though he claims that he is only there for the money, Meinhard is the only worker who makes an effort to bridge the divide with the locals. Finding himself alone on a country road, he hitches a ride with some villagers and begins a friendship with Adrian (Syuleyman Alilov Letifov), one of the locals. In conversation, Meinhard claims to be a member of the Foreign Legion with service in Afghanistan and Africa which they accept without question. While on a drive in the countryside with Adrian, Meinhard tells him that this is \"Paradise,\" to which Adrian replies in Bulgarian, \"We understand each other.\" It is never clear, however, what is really understood and what is not. Despite the growing closeness of the relationship between Meinhard and the locals, the difficulty in communicating adds to the tension which threatens on several occasions to spill over into violence. There is a dispute about water rights which the crew needs to mix the gravel, a confrontation after a poker game in which Meinhard wins too much money, and an incident when he gets in the middle of a dispute with mafia-like authorities. At one point, after being knocked to the ground, Meinhard asserts that \"Violence is not my thing,\" though, when asked about the planet, he offers his opinion that it is only the strong who survive.Grisebach keeps our attention by drawing on anecdotal threads that complement the narrative. A white horse, whose custody is a matter of dispute, is injured when Vincent leads him to a mountain he cannot navigate; Wanko (Kevin Bashev), a young boy whose parents are in Greece to find work, is temporarily knocked unconscious when he hits Meinhard falling from a truck. Grisebach expresses her reliance on narrative spinoffs this way, \"It's really to find how you have this little plot point or a little suspenseful moment,\" she says, \"and then you create space, more space for atmosphere.\" There is plenty of atmosphere in Western, but where it is headed and indeed what it is about is a guessing game throughout. The film's well-drawn characters and naturalistic look and feel keep us engaged, however, until it erupts in a dance of humanity and one man's dream of a life filled with the simplicity of friendship and brotherhood.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

A group of German construction workers in the Bulgarian countryside encounters difficulties with the locals and the foreign terrain. Tensions escalate from miscommunication, misuse of resources, corruption, selfishness, nationalism, arrogance and more. Meinhard, one of the Germans, becomes increasingly amiable with the locals. He attempts to understand their culture and ways, shares his knowledge, teaches a kid to ride a horse, helps with little tasks and drinks rakia (local liquor) late into the night with his new companions. Many among the Germans and Bulgarians do not like this. Even as Meinhard discovers solutions to difficulties and benefits to getting along, there are those in the shadows who want the divisions to remain and who believe that unless you eat, you will be eaten.A compelling, wonderful and classical story of a vulnerable dreamer who dares to drift across the divide. The director maintained in the question and answer session after the film, that she places emphasis on what is going on inside the characters rather than any ultimate showdown. It is good that she does this, as it is truer to life. It allows the audience (me) to better identify with the characters. Non-professional actors were used in all the roles and the gamble worked, because the film felt more authentic this way. The director also maintained that she was not a micro-manager. She gave the actors space and the trust provided dividends. It makes me wonder why anyone, filmmaker or not, insists upon complete control. In advance of making the film, Grisebach lived in and learned about the area and its people, which turned out to be another good habit on her part.

{"imdbId": "tt5157326", "movieTitle": "Western", "title": "Really bleak and really good", "author": "Horst in Translation (filmreviews@web.de)", "postedDate": "25 August 2017", "reviewContent": "\"Western\" is a new movie that has managed a pretty strong deal of awards recognition already, not just at the Cannes Film Festival. It is a co-production between Germany, Bulgaria and Austria. The writer and director is Valeska Grisebach and she recently made the headlines as she was a script consultant on the Oscar-nominated Toni Erdmann. But while she worked in that position on other films too, she also wrote and directed before. This is over a decade ago already and I have seen her previous work \"Sehnsucht\" and liked it too. Her style is easily recognizable. I can only talk about that film and this one here, but there is something very bleak to her works and the characters are like you and me basically, really normal guys that make decisions that have a massive impact on their lives. Be it cheating or, like in this one here, the decision to leave Germany (temporarily) for Bulgaria and accept the offer as a construction worker abroad.This is the central character and while he manages to get along with the locals really nicely, there is also a strong opposite of that, a man who kills one of the locals' horses, gets in trouble with a local woman, turns off a local well etc. These are the two men in the center of it all on the German side. And if I see it correctly, then none of the actors had any acting experience before, which also adds to Grisebach's Everyday Joe approach. I cannot really say anything about the Bulgarian actors really as I don't know any of them. Gonna leave that to the Bulgarians. One of the key aspects here is testosterone as really all men, all German men, in here except the protagonist really want to show their masculinity to everybody and funnily enough the central character is eventually the one who gets the hot girl. It's especially interesting that a female writer came up with this very male-centered story. It's like tables turned on Detlev Buck writing teenage chick flicks \u00e0 la Bibi und Tina.But back to this one here. We have several scenes when we see the protagonist getting assaulted. And he says on one occasion that he is not one for fighting. Then interestingly enough if we ignore the knife scene in the water, the only real moment when he does get aggressive (too much actually) and pulls a gun is when his new friend gets attacked. So he sure is a very loyal guy and may put the good of those dear to him above his own happiness. On a similar note, the component of violence increases the longer the film goes. Early on we have a scene when a guy presses a girl playfully under water. Next up a scene when a man accidentally injures a kid. Then there is a scene with a pulled knife. Then there is a scene with a terribly injured horse suffering a lot before it finally gets put out of its misery. Then there is the pulled gun scene I mentioned before. And there are more examples. These scenes let me think that Grisebach will end the film on a really violent note with the protagonist either killing somebody or getting killed himself. There were really enough possibilities as he kept antagonizing people too. But this is where Grisebach returns to her standards unspectacular approach and the film just ends with a dance scene that shows us the central character for once not distant or on his own, but instead joining the townsfolk. This also underlines the comment by the protagonist's friend at some point that what happened, also (or especially) the violent stuff, is just not too uncommon for the Bulgarian countryside. It's a rough area with even rougher people.All in all, Grisebach proves with her work that she is certainly among Germany's finest female filmmakers/writers looking at how well she understands the male psyche and it's at least on the same level as Doris D\u00f6rrie's films centering around men. Grisebach shouldn't be sad that another film got picked representing Germany at the upcoming Oscars I think, maybe because this one here had too much Bulgarian instead of German dialogue to it. This is also a very interesting film as we have so much about the subject of immigrants coming to Germany these days, so here we see how it's done the other way around. How it should be done. It's a really long film at pretty much exactly 2 hours, but maybe with the slightly too long introduction in the first 20 minutes, this is a film that never drags for a bit and I was genuinely curious what would happen next to the central characters and how their stories would continue. Grisebach proves that you don't need experienced big-name actors if you have a smart script and manage to make it an atmospheric watch. Of course, this doesn't mean any of the actors were bad. On the contrary, they all felt very real and authentic in their approaches. Finally, the tone and style will turn this into a film that is definitely not for everybody. But if you manage to find an emotional access to the story and an interest in the characters, then you will be greatly rewarded. There were moments when I considered giving the movie an even higher rating. It's really difficult to find something wrong with the film. I initially did not like the title too much, but the more I think about it the more this makes sense too as it is a bit of a western, even if it is set in Eastern Europe. There is a dry prairie-like area, there's guns and knives, there's lone wolf characters, strong alpha males and a lot of conflict that may or may not be solved in a violent fashion. I absolutely recommend the watch here. Without a doubt one of Germany's (and Bulgaria's) finest from 2017.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

In Game Night, writer Mark Perez and directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein have crafted a tightly structured story with little visual tricks that turn out to be significant. That said, the movie really lives and dies by its cast, and this is a top-notch ensemble. Morris -- dependably funny on TV's New Girl -- gets laughs from his bubbling jealousy and dead-on Denzel Washington impersonation, clicking well with Bunbury. Horgan drily delivers as someone who's far too smart for her date; you'll likely wish there was more of her in the film. Magnussen is spectacularly idiotic as Ryan, which is a gift. Open-hearted blockheads are always welcome in comedies such as this, and Magnussen -- who's shown his dramatic chops in the likes of Birth of the Dragon -- hits it out of the park. Plemons' dead-eyed Gary generates big laughs by doing as little as possible. His stony \"I see you\" face and monotone delivery steal every scene he's in. (At one point, he happily invites the group into his house ... and, with a frozen smile, slowly backs into the darkness.)And as Max and Annie, Bateman and McAdams have great chemistry. Their timing together, their small reactions to each other; they really read as a couple who love each other, have a lot in common, and accept each other's quirks. Oh, and they're really funny. Bateman, as usual, is an effective straight man with subdued wit. McAdams gets to be a little wackier than usual and has some superb reaction moments.

TED Talk?\"If you're game for a hilarious night at the movies, then see the black comedy Game Night. This romantic thriller is a mix of screwball comedy, Marx Brothers slapstick, and witty repartee you'll vow to go back for (about the handsomer brother: \"He's like the Mark Wahlberg to Max's Donnie!\") so you can catch at least half of the brilliant dialogue from the pen of writer Mark Perez.Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) is a childless married couple who relax with friends playing highly competitive games like Scrabble and Charades. This night, however, with the return of his charming, successful brother, Brooks (Kyle Chandler), the game becomes fraught with sibling rivalry and violence that somehow never eclipses the humor. For the audience, determining what is just a game and what is real is the enjoyable endgame, and not easily solved.The high-flying chases and quips remind me of Grant and Russell in their screwball days, throwing intellectual barbs while their lives are at stake (about a ditzy blonde guest: \"Where'd you find her? TED Talk?\"). Although Bateman has cornered the market on the clueless but still sharp middle class professional with the classic slow burn, McAdams is a discovery as a robust bright partner only a little clueless but plenty savvy. Her takeoff on Amanda Plummer with the diner hostages in Pulp Fiction is priceless. Besides McAdams' surprise comedic chops, Jesse Plemons as the off- center, next-door cop Gary sheds his Matt Damon lookalike calling card and crafts a memorable role to prove his talent as a comic character.

Directed by Horrible Bosses writing duo and Vacation director's John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, Game Night takes the one-time nerd only board game night to the big-time as we find ourselves a part of a games night with a difference as Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdam's game loving couple Max and Annie and their collection of friends find themselves trying to rescue Max's successful brother Brooks (played brilliantly against type by Kyle Chandler) from a real-life hostage situation. It's a high concept central idea and one that works thanks to Daley and Goldstein's assured and often imaginatively constructed direction and the ability for the film to both not take itself too seriously or not playing to the lowest common denominators. It feels like many moons since a comedy of this ilk wasn't filled with unnecessary profanities, sex jokes and loud-mouthed side characters but thankfully Game Night largely avoids these comedic pitfalls and just focuses itself on telling a genuinely good story with a large collection of jokes that work on their own merits. It's great to see Daley and Goldstein advance from their Horrible Bosses writing breakthrough and the relative misfire of their updating of the Vacation series as Game Night is without question the most assuredly filmed Hollywood comedy in sometime.David Fincher himself would be proud as the duo give the film a visual flair and pizazz not often found in such genre films, from the way in which they shoot some establishing shots like a real-life board game or an eye-popping keeping's off sequence in a glamorous house, Game Night is filled with visual gems that when combined with Drive and Neon Demon composer Cliff Martinez's score, create a memorable mood and setting. Coinciding with Daley and Goldstein's wins is the work of the films cast. Jason Bateman is as Jason Batemany as you'd expect but surrounded by the likes of Rachel McAdams (who looks like she's never had this much fun) and a downright hilarious Jesse Plemon's as Max and Annie's super awkward and potentially serial-killer like neighbour Gary, the whole cast elevate each other's work to a level that makes you hope this isn't the last game night we will be spending with this colourful bunch. Final Say - Like any good games night, Daley and Goldstein's film provides a lot of fun, laughs and genuinely memorable times. Game Night is Hollywood comedy filmmaking done right and by avoiding the problems that have faced its recent cohorts (overlong running times, unnecessary vulgarity, annoying characters); Game Night becomes a highly recommendable night out at the movies. 4 Faberg\u00e9 egg's out of 5", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Not the paramedic or former soldier - no the psychologist (you would assume a psychologist might be sensitive and sweet). And for some reason this psychologist has been making the decisions regarding who enters this anomaly (a.k.a. The Shimmer). I'm not even sure she is part of the government - which I assumed was in control of the facility because they capture Lena's escaped husband in the beginning third of the movie.A male soldier's insides have been completely mutated and swirling around like a worm, but somehow he is still alive. Upon seeing this on video, a former paramedic exclaims it was a lighting trick and to not believe what they just saw (Aside: pretty much all of us in the theater burst out laughing).A former soldier is using night-vision goggles to see out into the dark - but she's standing in the middle of a booth-type structure with the lights on - which obviously would disrupt the ability to use the night-vision goggles.Cells extracted and plated from Lena's blood are rapidly dividing and mutating, but somehow she is not extremely sick and dying?The ending is so exceptionally weird that I'm not sure a written description could even come close to accurate.

I don't even know what specifically I've been thinking about, all I can say is it left a big impression on me. I disagree with those who say it's intellectual. I don't think it is nor was it intended to be. It's visceral, primal, just like the world inside The Shimmer.For me, films work on three hierarchical levels: at the very basic, they should be entertaining. All films should succeed here (but not all do, which is why we should rightly slam those that don't!). Then, there are films that are not only entertaining but also elicit an emotional response; they move us in some way. Finally, there are entertaining films that are moving but also have meaning; they resonate on a deeper, often metaphysical level. To my mind, Annihilation achieves all three.Forget the plot holes. They exist in every film, otherwise they wouldn't be stories. Some of my favourite films have canyon-sized plot holes and inconsistencies. If you analyse any film you'll find them, and often you don't have to look very hard, e.g. Back to the Future. Do the plot holes and gaps in logic stop BTTF from being a great film? Not to my mind, because I'm invested in the movie. Plot holes only matter to me when they draw me away from the film; if it fails to entertain me.Does the plot in Annihilation even really matter? The film is about the experience, the visuals and audio, the curiosity, the suspense. A world that could only be accessible to us in our imaginations is here brought to life on the screen. It asks a lot of questions but isn't interested in the answers. It's bold, brave, challenging. Some of it is spectacular, some of it less so. Naturally, that will split opinion, but we've become too accustomed to the ready-packaged \"Happy Meal Movies\" that the studios churn out for us. We're addicted to them like we're addicted to sugary fast food. We should welcome any film that attempts to wean us off that and broaden our palates.

No.\nNot your standard sci-fi flick, Annihilation has a slow but promising start. It is full of excellent performers that give the caliber of performance you'd expect from them - Portman stands out, but the rest of the female ensemble all hold their own while facing their personal demons and also facing a weird, and a seemingly hostile alien landscape invading Earth. Rodriguez is probably the most surprising.

Now, imagine that the being occupying your lover's body is the same being you encountered the day before in a different body. Each day that the spirit of your lover inhabits that body, the original owner is sequestered elsewhere. Afterward, he or she has no memory of this virtual body snatching. \"The Vow\" director Michael Sucsy's \"Every Day\" qualifies as something fresh, rewarding, and different from the usual Young Adult fantasy teeming with angst-riddled youth negotiating the obstacle course of love. \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\" scenarist Jess Andrews adapted David Levithan's 2012 novel \"Every Day.\" Since I haven't read the novel, I cannot comment on the film's fidelity to the source material. Unfortunately, neither Sucsy nor Andrews shed light on some of the questions that you cannot help pondering throughout this provocative, 95-minute, PG-13, soaper. Presumably, they saw no point in answering these questions because it would interfere with the buoyant romance that unfolds for Angourie Rice as the girl who experiences love with a different face each day. Mind you, despite the apparent problems that would dog such a relationship, the heroine has no problem finding her lover in his or her's new body. Certainly, \"Every Day\" embraces the idea that love is more than skin deep. Our heroine finds herself adapting on a daily basis to her lover's choice of bodies, not only racially different, but also sexually different. At times, the heroine's lover appropriates the body of a lesbian or a gay guy. Despite these radical departures, she maintains the relationship without question. No, \"Every Day\" differs from the conventional Young Adult bathos and indulges itself in ways that heretofore have never been tried. Indeed, it has the sensibility of an indie film with its experimental storyline and its willingness to cross gender boundaries without the standard melodramatics. Angourie Rice is splendid as Rhiannon, and the youthful cast doesn't embarrass itself. The same can be said for the adults who play the parents. The disembodied consciousness known soully as \"A\" follows a pattern that takes it from teens with few problems to teens with overwhelming woes.

Unfortunately these movies often lack in the unique department, copying each other's story like Hallmark copies its own plots. Yet, they still reign supreme in the movie world, unafraid to remain the cute, cuddly, and melodramatic. This weekend though, another book adapted to movie takes a shot at relieving us from this mundane rush, to add a little flair back into the romantic atmosphere. My review, as you can read, is on Every Day, starring Angourie Rice and a mess of other young actors. What is in store? Read on to find out my friends. LIKES: Acting: Many romantic comedies involving teenagers are often overacted performances that are not easy for me to stomach in the volumes I see movies in. Every Day on the other hand manage to keep the acting in check, with performances that felt like kids in every day high school. As the central character, Rice did a fantastic job of handling the teenager caught between so many lives that require her energy to invest in. As for the remainder of the cast, all the extras from the jerk boyfriend (Justice Smit) to the final host of A all have their parts to play, and each represent there lifestyle stigmatism well. Such a dynamic cast kept things fun, and the story more intriguing than the run of the mill romance. The Morals: The story is primarily a love story, but amidst the kissing, hugging, and cuddling is a strong series of ethical dilemmas that the characters must face. It starts with the common moral dilemma of finding respectful love vs. settling, teaching young kids that love does exist outside the realms of popularity and physical aspects. Soon Rhiannon (Rice) starts crashing into things such as familial discord, self-identity, and trying to move on from something because it's the right thing to do. Her ever changing opposite (A) also has plenty to face with his powers too, as each person he inhabits has issues themselves that constantly challenge his happiness and ability to have a life he so desires. These head scratchers are perfect for the young minds to soak up into and good refresher for any, leaving you reviewing your own ideas upon exiting the theater. Nevertheless, these ideas are well-baked into the tale, perfect to drive the story more. The Twist: Let's face it, romantic comedies have difficulty with surprising me, the plots so predictable and similar that one can't help but try to fight sleep sometimes. Every Day's twist to the story doesn't defy the predictability in terms of ending, but the concept itself is the intriguing part to this story. The premise of having your love interest switch to a new body every day crosses a bridge most people haven't attempted to and it worked for me. Seeing what new adventures they would go on, how they would solve the next problem, and even how they would make this whole endeavor work were some of the questions keeping me invested in the movie. However, the biggest question of who or what A is, that is the real thing I tried to figure out. So many mysteries amidst the romantic atmosphere makes this movie stand out. DISLIKES:The Predictability: The movie has such a unique twist, one was hoping to have a unique ending in the works as well. Every Day's presentation may stand out, but it's ending falls back in line with the usual endings that this genre is famous for. While a bit vague at points and somewhat lackluster given the build-up they were providing. However, one should be able to see the ending coming from a mile away, and despite being on the realistic, ethically inclined side, it still lacks the emotional shine you had hoped to see. Problems Swept Under the Rug: I mentioned how much I liked the ethics in this film and the real life portrayals of the problems that plague the world. I also would have liked to see those problems have a little more development, pacing, and satisfying conclusion than what I got. The love aspect get the most attention, there's a surprise, but as for the other dilemmas, well they get the quick treatment. Some of these make sense because again they are one life A must live and maximize, however Rhiannon's family problems are ones that she has to live with constantly, so perhaps they should have cultivated a little more integration of these problems into the movie. It would have made an interesting side story to help integrate her family into the picture, providing yet another aspect to help with this awkward relationship. Unrealistic: No duh, a person switching lives every day is totally unrealistic, however that's not the component I'm talking about. Instead, Rhiannon's unrealistic component is how little her school work and discipline suffers despite skipping as much as she does. If many had pulled the antics she did, they would have been expelled, fortunately the power of love seemed to have rescued them. This component is ignorable to most, but for me it was cheesy and unobtainable, only taking away for the story. Unanswered questions: The movie invests an entire ten minute dialogue to try to explain the origins of A's powers. As such, at the end I was hoping for some actual answers and hopefully get a nice tie up to A's journey of body invasion. Once again, story fails to fill in the gaps, giving little information to clarify the fog of A's life, in favor of teaching a lesson about moving on. Yeah, they took the emotionally stirring route, but in terms of story, they should have closed this book much better in regards to answers. MY VERDICT: Every Day breaks the mold on the typical romantic comedy presentation with its unique concept of a lover switching bodies with each passing 24 hours. All the morals that come with this responsibility add an extra layer to the a generic plot, helping to keep your mind engaged instead of rapidly decaying into a lazy sponge that rom coms have come up with. And those twists that seemed so admirable, didn't quite reach the pinnacle of what I'm sure the book was able to accomplish. Problems are ignored or swiftly wrapped up, the ending still remains predictable and sadly the questions raised are left only slightly answered. Therefore, this romantic comedy stands out on some qualities, but still drowns in the mundane tactics that Hollywood has become. So worth a trip to the movie theater?

It's obviously enhanced by the premise but not really dictated by it, despite the interesting and looming presence it has. The flick may sound like schlocky, sentimental fare but it is far from the sort and actually navigates it's unique narrative rather deftly, quickly getting you on board with its 'out there' elements and making sure that every incarnation of its body-swapping character feels like a proper continuation of the same person. It's never too predictable or clich\u00e9d but does usually play it pretty safe, aside from its satisfyingly ballsy and one-step-ahead-of-the-audience ending. It also doesn't go far enough in certain directions that may be tried-and-tested, but are only so for good reason, to compensate for the fact that it also doesn't quite stretch far into its newer territory to be anything other than surprisingly good for what it is, though. It's much better than I was expecting, but the core concept does feel like it could've been explored further.

As the movie opens, we see Hannah and her husband go about their daily routine, and then it becomes clear that something is up, before we know it, Hannah's husband is getting ready to be dropped off at a prison. What is going on here? At this point we're less than 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Italian director Andrea Pallaoro, who previously gave us the equally excellent \"Medeas\". Here Pallaoro goes one better yet, and looks at how an elderly woman deals with the consequences of her long-time husband going to prison. The first issue is of course, what did the husband don exactly? The answer is given in subtle hints at various points in the movie, but one might even argue that it isn't all that relevant, as indeed the focus is on Hannah. She tries to make the best of a terrible situation, and continues to provide support to her husband. When she goes to visit him in prison, she musters a smile when he appears, to which he snarls \"Why are you laughing?\". Just chilling. And what to say about this extraordinary performance (yet again) by Charlotte Rampling? As she continues to age gracefully (she is now in her early 70s), she continues to find (or be offered) roles that are challenging and rewarding (check out also 2015's $5 Years, and this year's Red Sparrow). \"Hannah\" premiered at last year's Venice Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim (Rampling won the Best Actress award). I happen to catch this during a recent family visit to Belgium. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at in Antwerp, Belgium was attended quite nicely, somewhat to my surprise, given that this is not the most joyful of films. If you are in the mood for a great character study of an elderly woman dealing with difficult issues, I'd readily suggest you check this out. It's doubtful at this point that this will get a US theatrical release, so look for it on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

They believe the place is haunted and follow three rules of survival: they must be in bed by midnight; they may not allow a stranger to cross the threshold; and they must stay together. When they are eighteen, their tutor and lawyer Bermingham (David Bradley) advises that they must sell the real estate since their trust fund is exhausted but Edward is reluctant to leave the property.

The title using 'young' is realistic; a man most known for the 'birth' of communism is the premise of the film and it was super compelling. This film could have had more style sure, but what is style if there is no substance. Communism has a collaborative process so it was great to see its collaborative side through a fantastic supporting cast ushered by an intelligent screenplay, though the film may be overwhelming for some with its excessive discussion of 'Marxist' philosophy. You never see Marx in a room by himself which ignores an independent or 'hero' image that he may be associated with because he was honestly a family man who liked to chat and have a good laugh.

Intrigued, I ordered Gabriel's book. By the time I finished Love and Capital I was, as the British say, \"gob smacked.\" What puzzled and surprised me, as a filmmaker, was that this turbulent epic, utterly engrossing and deeply romantic, had attracted so little attention. Why had this story not made it to the big screen, or materialized into a blockbuster television series? Is the name Karl Marx still so anathema? Then, last Sunday, a new film titled The Young Karl Marx (Le Jeune Karl Marx) which premiered at the 2017 Berlin International Film Festival, suddenly found its way to the Amherst Cinema. In spite of some tepid reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, curiosity lured me to the screening. I have no regrets: The Young Karl Marx (YKM) is a rare and unusual film\u2014beautifully-acted by a stellar cast, craftily scripted, and heavily focused on political content and character. Here is how Peter Bradshaw reviewed it in the Guardian/UK: \"Raoul Peck is the Haitian film-maker who has an Oscar nomination this year with his James Baldwin documentary I Am Not Your Negro. Now he comes to Berlin with this sinewy and intensely focused, uncompromisingly cerebral period drama\u0085about the birth of communism in the mid-19th century. It gives you a real sense of what radical politics was about: talk. There is talk, talk and more talk. It should be dull, but it isn't. Somehow the spectacle of fiercely angry people talking about ideas becomes absorbing and even gripping.\"At the film's center is its title character, played brilliantly by August Diehl. Bradshaw describes Diehl's Marx as \"ragged, fierce with indignation and poverty, addicted to cheap cigars, spoiling for an argument and a fight.\" This is the notoriously nasty side of the Marx persona. But as Gabriel's book, and many other biographies reveal, Marx's character is fascinatingly complex. I have often tried to imagine what Marx must have been like, but been unable to wrap my brain around his multi-sided character. Exploring the complexities of Marx, the man, is perhaps the film's greatest strength. For starters, Marx was viewed by his contemporaries as smart as a whip. Moses Hess, a socialist and early Zionist, provides this over-the- top description to his friends of 24-year old Marx: \"\u0085you can look forward to meeting the greatest, perhaps the only real philosopher now living. \u0085He combines a biting wit with deeply serious philosophical thinking. Imagine Rousseau, Voltaire, Holbach, Lessing, Heine and Hegel united in one person, I say united, not lumped together \u2014 and you have Dr. Marx.\" Edmund Wilson described Marx as the greatest satirist since Jonathan Swift. But he was also a pussy cat: Wilhelm Liebknecht, who was constantly in the household during the 1850s, remembered Marx as \"the most tender father: one must have seen Marx with his children to obtain a complete notion of the depths of sentiment and the childlike nature of this hero of Wissenschaft (academic pursuit). In his free minutes, or while strolling, he brought them along, played the wildest and most lively games with them\u2014 in short he was a child among children. \"Children should educate their parents,\" said Marx, and lived up to the dictum by keeping in step with the reading, entering the fantasy life and adjusting his views to meet the religious scruples of his engaging youngest daughter, Tussy. Marx tells her the story of the Passion \u2014\"the carpenter whom the rich men killed,\" adding that much can be forgiven Christianity because it has taught the adoration of the child. Because YKM dramatizes only a short five year period in Marx's life (1842 to 1847) a great deal of the Marx family saga remains untold: childhood and family life in Trier; Marx's scorching love affair with the baron's daughter, Jenny von Westphalen; the crucial role of his wife and three daughters in aiding and abetting him at every turn; Karl's betrayal of Jenny goes public when Lenchen, the family housekeeper, gives birth to Karl's illegitimate son Freddy, leaving it to Engels to save Marx's bacon by falsely claiming paternity of the boy, thereby rescuing Karl and Jenny's marriage. Perhaps these fascinating omissions will be addressed when the Marx family saga finally becomes a long-running television series--whenever that may come to pass. While we wait, Le Jeune Karl Marx is well worth the price of admission.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

They were highly educated intellectuals, which is well communicated. Marx as a critic of everything is profoundly integrated. The same goes for the friendship between them, how deep it was and how it developed: well communicated. While Marx was not as poor as the proletariat, he indeed struggled to survive and provide for his family. Something that is also shown properly. His relationship with Jenny, however, is mostly overlooked and only abstract, his kids are nearly completely left out of the picture.The ideas of Engels and Marx that are portrayed are only basic, but formulated on a level not so basic...their intellect is basically communicated too well. This movie has great potential to spread their ideas and to introduce new people to the idea of Communism, it does however take some knowledge to understand the concepts thrown around. As such the movie has failed in the way that it only deals with the top layer of their ideas but fails to clarify them clearly. Therefore it only has potential.Clothing style and the used shots and settings seem very realistic, the atmosphere feels right. The feeling of the Communist specter haunting Europe is kind of missing for the lack of any real footage of revolts/uprisings. The struggle should have been visualized.The movie is about the young Karl Marx (and Engels I would add, he is there for the most part, an intrinsic part of Marx'life), as such it is an introduction into his life. The foundation upon which his book 'Capital' has been build. Following this summary, the movie itself is also an introduction and foundation upon which could be build. With more knowledge of their work, and perhaps a better understanding as to enhance clarification, its potential could be multiplied.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

During the Berlinale press conference dedicated to the film Raoul Peck was asked if he read Karl Marx. He answered that he attended seminars dedicated to Marx's Capital. His film is reminiscent of such a seminar; interminable and tedious.There are many dialogues, questions, answers however the film completely lacks artistic vision. There is no interesting music, camera-work or a gripping plot.Raoul Peck tried to underline the more materialistic side of his relationship with Jenny, showing his sex life and child birth. To deprive Marx of certain romanticism is also not fair, the young philosopher was a romantic of his own kind; he was engaged for seven years to Jenny and dedicated many poems to her.The discussions depicted in the film are too primitive for such great thinkers such as Marx, Engels, Proudhon and Bakunin. The proletariat, on the other hand, is shown as a group of people with abject faces and feeble children, which makes the ideas of Marx about the proletariat too idealistic and not connected to reality.One of the positive sides of the picture is that Peck did not try to distort facts about the people in the film, however after the film finishes one feels relieved that the drawn-out seminar on Karl Marx is finally over.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2017/02/young-karl-marx/", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt6164502", "movieTitle": "November", "title": "Beautifully Bleak", "author": "gavin6942", "postedDate": "23 July 2017", "reviewContent": "Based on a best-selling Estonian novel, \"November\" is a mixture of magic, black humor and romantic love. The story is set in a pagan Estonian village where werewolves, the plague, and spirits roam. The villagers' main problem is how to survive the cold, dark winter. And, to that aim, nothing is taboo. People steal from each other, from their German manor lords, and from spirits, the devil and even Christ.The jaded genre fan, this reviewer included, rarely says \"what the heck??\" when watching a film. Because, frankly, once you have reviewed over 6,000 titles including some of Takashi Miike's craziest work (\"Visitor Q\") you feel like you have seen it all. But then comes the opening scene of \"November\", leaving you wide-eyed and full of glee. What is this medieval, cow-stealing robot? This magical creature is a \"kratt\", which comes from Estonian mythology. If you happen to be like me, you don't know anything about Estonian mythology. Well, a kratt is a collection of sticks, straw and farm implements that is granted life by the devil after its make offers up some blood, representing their soul. The maker then commands the kratt, who spends most of its time stealing things \u2013 including cows \u2013 for its master. If someone is especially clever, they can use blackcurrant berries rather than blood; the devil apparently does not check very closely, and you end up getting a kratt without forfeiting your soul. (You probably anger the devil in the process, but that is a whole other story.) Besides the kratt, the first thing that stands out is the beautiful cinematography in grey, creating a bleak world and occasionally the picture even looks washed out. Often, black and white looks better than color, in part because it allows for greater contrast. Interestingly, it looks great here despite the lack of contrast; this is a murky land, and it is viewed in a murky fashion. Such a choice seems appropriate for this village of squalor, and it causes me to wonder if perhaps Robert Eggers' \"The Witch\" might have benefited from black and white? While there are multiple plots and subplots occurring simultaneously, the central focus is a young woman named Liina (Rea Lest) who is hopelessly and forlornly in love with a village boy named Hans (Jorgen Liik). There romance is pretty standard, the typically boy meets girl story in a small village. Except that one of the two runs the risk of becoming a werewolf. And yes, this actually makes complete sense.Rea Lest is a new actress and will not be familiar to North American audiences. Jorgen Liik is slightly more experienced, but again will probably not appear familiar. The one actor who should definitely stand out is Dieter Laser, who appears as the baron. Active since the 1960s, today Laser is almost universally recognized for his starring roles in \"The Human Centipede\" and its second sequel. His role is important not just because he is a baron, but because he represents the more mainstream, anti-pagan religious and Christian views in the film.A scene at the church suggests a rejection of Christ in favor of folk magic, but instead we have to wonder if they really accept a mixture of the two? They clearly believe in the folk ways (werewolves, talking with spirits) but do not reject the Christian views entirely. One hunter uses blessed communion wafers in his hunting, believing that Christ guides him. There is also a preoccupation with souls; whether longing for a soul, selling your soul, or living without a soul, the theme of souls comes up again and again.After exceptional cinematography, the thing that stands out most is the menacing music, creating a constant sense of unease. There is even the inclusion of \"Blue Danube\" into the score. For reasons unknown, that song has always left me feeling uncomfortable, at least as far back as 1992 when it was incorporated into the video game \"Alone in the Dark\". It seems no less unsettling to me here.\"November\" plays July 23, 2017 at the Fantasia International Film Festival, and is one of the more highly-anticipated films of the 3-week schedule.

Not to worry. Our tiny heroine is on hand to save the day and kill him a second time! By this point I got the impression the audience was supposed to be rooting for her, which wasn't easy after her moronic actions had effectively killed everyone on board.Inevitably, the female is the only survivor and ends up stranded in the middle of the ocean.

I'm thinking foreigners must think Americans are bullying idiots if they have movies like this and our current politics to go by.This is a \"Why Did I Bother\" film. First thought is who choose to take a civilian on a covert mission? Would they have had to kill anyway because of what he's seen and heard while down there? Otherwise it's not likely to be found if no one saw it go down in the first place and if they had, they would have salvaged it before America came in to save the day.Also, their is two likable character in the movie of four people and of course they both die just because of film directors budget cuts or a \"oh, well let's wrap this up and forget it not having any substance\" attitude.

Look this witch has every reason to feel guilt for all her bad decision, starting with lying to a civilian and using them. All I could think in the end was good, I hope she suffers and die slowly.I guess you can see by my review, I did not like this film and it wasn't the actors. The actors did fine with what they were working with. No, there was just not enough debt of importance written into the situation to make it worth dying for. So you're thinking, just go back get a better sub now that you know what you are dealing with and go back later.This is how I would have written it: The owner of the submarine should have lied to them about how great his submarine is to get there money, like the Captain in JAWS and the Captain in ANACONDA and they get on it and find out it's a lemon and proceed with the story. But this is a very honest man, he explains several time how his ship is old and has to be treated so gently they couldn't even wear their boots in it.It would have given her a reason to be make bad judgment calls, as it stood you're thinking she is not intelligent enough to be a high rank an official as she is pretending to be.

It highly exceeds War Wolf series that the top Asian box office hit film franchise in film history. China is the most successful socialist country and its film policy is socialist realism. The origin of this tradition was Chapayev (1937) and Alexander Nevsky (1939). You can see old fashioned propaganda films are bureaucratically failed in dogmatism and mixed with art film style in the past. They just hated Hollywood genre films in terms of propaganda war. What they forgot in the past was what Lenin and Eisenstein said for film style. Eisenstein said: 'Applying all valuable achievements in the art practices no matter whether it's feudalistic or capitalistic. Moreover, there is no so called 'socialist culture'. There will be only humanistic culture within classless society.' This is the true NEP in filmmaking. That is the true 'socialist realism' if use this term not in stalinist meaning. The contemporary Chinese filmmakers consciously learned both Hollywood and Hong Kong genre filmmaking that the most people enjoy in the modern society. That does not mean abandon of socialism but it is the necessary evolution of technology and learning the most advanced stage of development of capitalist cultural devices is must for socialist filmmaking.  \nThe Operation Red Sea is based on The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s anti-pirates and anti-terrorist operations in Africa and Middle East regions. This topic itself is realist approach to the politically important and meaningful incidents that are really photogenic. There are several features I found in this viewing of this film below: 1. Editing is more sophisticated than War Wolf in terms of multi-camera genre film operation. 2. Consciously exploring expressions in angles, moments and spaces with VFX. We can see unusual deep expressions in dismantling bombs and shot bullet action lines in slow motioned CG. 3. Sand Storm sequence is obviously exceeding others that acting in sand storm is actually not done by others ever before. Sand storm in war film is something just should be avoided. On the other hand, this film fully shows dramatical use of sand storm environment. 4.Cinematography is perfect for avoiding TV like visual expression like War Wolf. However, it is weak in the interior of battleship sequences' filming. The lighting is TV studio-like result contrary to the sun lighted exterior scenes in this film. 5.Simon Yam is the only one speaks Cantonese with Putonghua speakers that is pretty weird. Should unify the language or Cantonese conversation is more natural. This unnaturally constructed scene is something from Hong Kong director's psychology. 6. War realism is realist expression of wounds, mutation and dead. Lucio Fulci-like realist approach to ugliness of real wounds, dead and mutation among roles are really effective and new. In conclusion, this is the perfect example of the cutting edge technology of Chinese filmmaking in 2018. And socialist realism is evaluated under the Chinese government leadership. It resolved anti-genre film dogmatism that cursed by old fashioned stalinist thought. I mostly appreciate this Hong Kong and Mainland China film corroboration that solves difficulties of Hong Kong film industry. \nThe Operation Red Sea is the one which has the high quality of Hollywood filmmaking standard and competitive with Hollywood films in terms of localization.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) and the rest of the top-notch cast try their damndest to give it some credibility but the story and premise make for a predictably silly and gratuitous affair on many levels.Dominika Egorova (Lawrence) is the top female dancer at the Bolshoi ballet theatre in Russia, who succumbs to a terrible injury that ruins her career. As the Bolshoi theatre seeks to wash its hands clean of 'damaged goods', giving her job and home to a rival, Dominika and her sick mother's welfare are put in jeopardy. Seeing an opportunity, Dominika's spymaster uncle makes her an offer she can't refuse, in return for the safeguard of her mother's health, leading her into the world of espionage and the Sparrow program, where seduction and the art of the honey-trap are the key weapons.By the time you get through a quarter of the mind-numbingly long, 139 minutes, the viewer is left in no doubt of Red Sparrow's predictable outcome. This inevitable plotline is laboured along by the director's attempts to mask it with half-assed twists and turns that just don't feel plausible when putting it in the life or death, professional espionage scenario that the story is supposed to portray. Joel Edgerton (The Gift) is as reliable as ever playing the CIA agent that she ends up in a game of cat and mouse with but the relationship does not feel natural, especially with how the script moves their love-tinged story along. The dialogue is cliche-ridden, telegraphic and Jennifer Lawrence, although competent enough, acting wise, lets her slightly dodgy accent drop every so often, making for some unintentional moments of humour. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy this is not.The main trio of 'evil' Russians has the very talented Matthias Schoenaerts (The Drop) - looking very Putinesque! - playing the devious spymaster uncle to a believable degree, Jeremy Irons hamming it up as a ruthless general and Charlotte Rampling in an absolutely ludicrously over-the-top role as the sinister Matron of the Sparrow program. The whole Sparrow training scene is like something out of Armand Ianucci's fantastic, The Death Of Stalin, minus the satire, as it serves to show the viewer how Russia is trying to take over the planet and that Russians are inherent bigots, deviants, rapists and sociopaths. These scenes are probably the most significant pile of gratuitous excrement that I've had grace my eyes and ears for quite some time.The overall theme of this nonsense is to remind us not to forget that Russians in general are twisted, violent and manipulative control freaks, while all the men are partial to being woman-beaters and rather rapey, apparently. And of course, the CIA are all good ole boys who occasionally mess up, but are out to free the world from tyranny and have everyone's best interests at heart. I kid you not. No exaggeration.I'm not sure how much screenwriter Justin Haythe (The Lone Ranger) carved up the story of the book but this is trashy beyond belief. One thing that is for sure is that director Francis Lawrence clearly knows that the biggest asset they have in this is Jennifer Lawrence's body, as the amount of disrobing or scantily clad scenes, along with blatant arse shots that she's subjected to, is off the charts. And when that is the most impressive aspect of your film, then you should know that there's a problem.

Frankly, I'm flabbergasted at the large number of low ratings - some weirdo rated it low as there was not ENOUGH nudity (clearly he must have wound up in the wrong theatre!), on the other end of the spectrum are the puritan nut-jobs who will denigrate an entire film because their hyper-active sensibilities are offended! Perhaps reading and understanding warning labels on movies would be useful to avoid future surprises - did the terms \"brutal violence, sexual violence, disturbing content, and nudity\" not give you a clue?I'm always really impressed how screenplay writers take an excellent and very complex book such as Red Sparrow and, out of necessity, condense the story/eliminate sub-plots and still come off with a movie adaptation that captures the basic premise of the book (and is shorter than 6hrs long!). I'm not sure why they substituted locations from the book (Helsinki and Rome/Athens) for Budapest and London (budget/logistics/tax incentives?), but it doesn't impact the story. I'm impressed with how the movie deftly wove key elements of the book into a shorter narrative, and yet still preserved the key story line and character arcs of the novel (for example the book has Californian Senator selling secrets to the SVR, while the movie puts this as the Chief of Staff to the US Ambassador to Hungary - enabling there to still be a mole hunt inside both the US and Russian governments). In one of the opening scenes, I was ready to criticize the film for lack-luster research - Nate is receiving a coded message which comprises a letter \"F\" phonetically relayed as \"Frank\" vice \"Foxtrot\" (you don't have to be in the Air Force or Type A - I am admittedly both) to know that NATO, ICAO, International Aviation, and Western militaries/police services around the world use \"Foxtrot.\" It kind of reminded me of those cheesy 80's cop shows that insist on using \"Baker\" vice \"Bravo.\" However, after this one albeit extremely minor error, I found myself immersed in a totally believable and realistic world of post-Cold War espionage.One reviewer said there was not a word of actual Russian spoken in the movie - again proving that some people are just not paying attention - I recall of at least one line when Dominika's boss speaks to her in Russian in the London hotel room. The number of reviewers that criticized the \"fake\" Russian accents to me must be Russians more upset about how the movie portrays Russia and Russian SVR ethics/tactics in a negative light. Considering the pedigree of the book's author, I'm inclined to believe in the realism and authenticity of the storyline. At least the actors made an effort to speak English with a Russian accent to lend authenticity to the story (and boy have we come a long way from Sean Connery's Scottish \"Russian\" accent in \"Hunt For Red October\" - and I'm an massive Connery fan!).Folks, without any spoilers here, this is a harsh and graphic movie, but intended to tell a story based on how espionage, intelligence and counter-intelligence work in the real world. The violence, torture and nudity in this film is not gratuitous at all, but essential to the authenticity and realism of the story. If people want mindless, \"no thinking required,\" family-friendly fluff, they should stick to Marvel, Disney or Pixar movies. I think Jennifer Lawrence does a brilliant job in this film; she has made another bold movie choice to broaden her character portfolio (personally, I wasn't a huge fan of \"Mother\" - but that is more me, not being a fan of that genre). The movie ending has a surprise plot-twist that deviates from the book - a forgivable Hollywood nuance to show justice/closure, and end on a slightly more positive note.

The film loses 8 stars, and I walked out, for the following laundry list of reasons:The characters are mostly cringey one dimensional stereotypes, who don't develop. All they care to convey is that Russia is evil, America is great. Every Russian man is the devil. Ugh. We get it. \nThe plot is a loose, waffling mess filled with either pointless scenarios, ridiculous scenarios or long drawn out useless scenes. Not sure why others are claiming there was tension or suspense, because there really wasn't any. Don't worry, I \"got it\". But it just wasn't worth getting. \nThe atmosphere is stale, clunky, and stilted. It never draws you in. Others have noted the film feels empty. \nThe dialogue is lower grade than the worst tv soap opera.\nThe accents are a joke. \nIt lacks any semblance of class or intelligence.\nIt is trying so hard to be sexy and edgy and but it's actually just so boring. People were legit falling asleep in the theatre.\nWhen people weren't falling asleep they were covering their eyes to escape the unnecessarily gruesome and jarring scenes of rape, rape again, gory violence, torture, more torture, Flashdance posed torture, skin peeling, etc etc etc. I can handle sex and violence but as others have said, this felt like a torture porn or a snuff film. It was very poorly done. \nThe direction and acting is flat out terrible. There is no excuse in 2018 when people should know what constitutes a good film.\nJLaw doesn't change facial expression. She is appallingly bad in this. Appallling. \nThere are heaps of mistakes that are very annoying, like the floppy disks and the hair dye. \nThe list goes on....This film is a blight on the industry, frankly.

Their fallen son is not just the Feldman family's loss; it can be an emblem of the Israeli storied toughness set against the absurdity of its fight and the cost to a relatively small but prominent world population.Basically a tripartite film, Foxtrot's first section languishes with the father, Michael (Lior Ashkenazi), as he responds to the universal call of two soldiers coming up their sidewalk, announcing the death to a fainting mother, Daphna (Sarah Adler). Moaz's shots are largely close up and over head both intended for us to feel his pain and his alienation. Never do these shots seem artsy; they are where we would be if we could enter Michael's space and view him from a judgment pov. For the second part, which shows the son, Jonathan (Yonotan Shiray), at a desert outpost, the camera is more distant and the light much brighter. As the narrative shows a soldier dancing with a rifle and an animated black and white sequence accompanied by a suckled breast, the tone has changed to playful and absurd. This airy sequence is appropriately comical to heighten the daily tragedies.Part three is the natural outcome of grief, itself accompanied by the foxtrot of the title, a simple dance to counter the daunting complexity of death and its aftermath. The film is a study of loss and grief exacerbated by a gritty culture that does not negotiate with the enemy and constantly deals with the Holocaust in its grief-laden memory.All this and more is in a remarkably deep and sometimes light study of war and its outcomes. Foxtrot was Israel's entry in the Oscar sweepstakes this year and deserving its considerable attention.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt6896536", "movieTitle": "Foxtrot", "title": "A brilliant and confounding film that reveals itself less by narrative than by images", "author": "Howard Schumann", "postedDate": "5 April 2018", "reviewContent": "Winner of the Silver Lion at the Venice International Film Festival and Israel's submission to the 2018 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film, Israeli director Samuel Maoz's (\"Lebanon\") brilliant and confounding Foxtrot reveals itself less by narrative than by images: A narrow road in an empty stretch of desert, a lonely camel meandering through a checkpoint, a young recruit's gyrating dance in the middle of the road, soldiers in a panic opening fire. Though the images imply condemnation of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the war, and Israel itself, Foxtrot is not an overtly political film but a family drama that has universal meaning to anyone who has suffered the unexpected loss of a loved one. The title suggests that life unfolds like a series of dance steps: Forward, side, and back in a preordained pattern, only to end up in the same place in which it began.Shown in the format of three connecting stories, in the first segment as Dafna Feldmann (Sarah Adler, \"The Cakemaker\") opens the front door of her upscale high-rise Tel Aviv apartment, she immediately knows that the look on the faces of officers of the IDF can mean only one thing. \"Mr. Feldmann,\" says the first soldier to Michael (Lior Ashkenazi, \"Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer\") who is lurking in the background, \"I'm sorry there's no easy way to say this. Your son Jonathan (Yonaton Shiray, \"A Tale of Love and Darkness\") was killed tonight in the line of duty.\" The officer does not say anything about the circumstances of his death, only that he had \"fallen in the line of duty,\" a military euphemism that puts a brave face on another in an endless stream of deaths to report on.Speechless, almost catatonic, Michael is told to keep drinking water by the officer who programs his cell phone to ring every hour to remind him. A successful architect, former tank commander, and the son of a survivor of Auschwitz, the tragic news unleashes the hidden rage that Michael has carefully kept from public view, directing it towards the unfeeling military bureaucracy. Fate, Maoz suggests, is not an unyielding emanation from God, but an innate part of a people's legacy passed down through generations. When we learn that his family has roots in the Holocaust, we understand that his paralysis of feeling can be traced to a childhood of quashing his emotions, a situation that creates, \"a new generation of victims.\" Though we can feel Michael's distress, his flashes of cruelty, especially towards his dog, are off-putting and perhaps designed to keep us at an emotional distance.The second segment takes place in a desolate military checkpoint known as \"Foxtrot,\" a supply road used by Palestinian cars and wandering camels, located somewhere on Israel's northern border. Moving from black comedy to tragedy, the sequence is an almost dreamlike and surreal allegory that provides an absurdist view of the war. The young soldiers, including Michael's son Jonathan, form a four-man guard who have become increasingly bored with the daily routine. They pass the time in their shipping container which serves as a barracks by telling each other stories about their home life, eating unappetizing meals out of cans, and rolling an empty tin of canned meat towards the wall to see how fast their container is sinking into the mud.In one of the most indelible moments of Foxtrot, Jonathan hugs his rifle and performs an unencumbered joy-filled dance in front of the barracks, a scene reminiscent of Galoup's wild, uninhibited dance that ends Claire Denis' masterful \"Beau Travail.\" Breaking the interminable quiet are cars carrying Palestinians seeking to pass through the checkpoint. Travelers are compelled to sit and wait for long periods of time and, in one instance, a couple dressed for a wedding are humiliated by being forced to stand outside in the pouring rain while the soldiers take their time checking their IDs. When an act of sudden violence against unarmed civilians occurs, an IDF commander covers it up, telling the perpetrators that they will not be punished, that unfortunate things sometimes happen in wars.In the third sequence, after the passage of several months, the film returns to the Feldmann's apartment as Michael and Dafna, now living apart, meet to remember what would have been Jonathan's twentieth birthday. Still processing their grief, Dafna strikes out at Michael for his weakness that she alleges caused Jonathan's death, but the music of Arvo P\u00e4rt's \"Spiegel im Spiegel\" tells us that, underneath the anger and the grief, their love is graced by the truth of acceptance and reconciliation and that, in the poet Rumi's phrase, \"the night ocean is filled with glints of light.\" Foxtrot has been roundly condemned by Israel's Minister of Culture and Sport, Miri Regev, (who hasn't seen the film) for its \"self-flagellation and cooperation with the anti-Israel narrative,\" calling it \"a work of treachery,\" and asking for the state to end funding for films that can be used as \"a weapon of propaganda for our enemies.\"In spite of the Minister's comments, Foxtrot won eight Ophir Awards (Israel's Oscar equivalent) including awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (for Ashkenazi), and Best Director. In an interview with The Times of Israel, Maoz responded to the critics by saying that the film was simply meant to open discussion and create dialogue, \"If I criticize the place I live,\" he said, \"I do it because I worry.\" After the recent killing of at least 15 unarmed Palestinians by Israeli soldiers near the barrier separating the Gaza Strip from Israel, an act for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered neither sympathy nor remorse, perhaps it is time for all of us to worry.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The most dreaded knock on the door. Every parent or spouse of someone who has served their country during war time fully understands that indescribable feeling of opening the door and seeing uniformed soldiers waiting to deliver the worst possible news. That knock is how Israeli writer/director Samuel Maoz (LEBANON, 2009) chooses to open his film. Knowing her son Daniel is dead sends Daphna (Sarah Adler) into hysterics, and the experienced messengers know to administer something to help her relax and sleep. Her husband Michael (Lior Ashkenazi, FOOTNOTE) stands stunned, mostly unable to respond.What follows is one of the most stunning first Act performances we've seen on the big screen. That is not hyperbole. Mr. Ashkenazi is remarkable over the first approximately 20 minutes as a parent in shock, experiencing devastating grief. The news is debilitating to his physical and mental being. Additionally, the filmmaking during this segment is quite something to behold. The close-ups add a heavy dose of humanity, while the terrific overhead camera angle presents Michael as trapped, while also adding to the disorientation that is so key. The one-hour alarm set to remind him to \"drink some water\" would be humorous if not for the fact that its structure prevents the man from totally breaking down.The second Act takes us away from Daphna's and Michael's contemporary Tel Aviv apartment and plops us into a remote military outpost where 4 young soldiers are charged with guarding a road passage. Thanks to this boring assignment, the young men find ways of adding interest to their days: timing canned goods that roll down the ever-increasing slope of their sinking-in-the-muck domicile container, raising the bar for the periodic camel that lopes by, and giving the rare passers-by a bit of a hard time as their ID's are checked. 'Of course, this is war territory, so when something goes wrong, it goes terribly and horrifically wrong.Our final Act takes us back to the original apartment as Michael, Daphna and their daughter are working to reconcile their feelings and somehow re-assemble the pieces of their shattered lives ... though the shifts from that heartbreaking first Act are what sets the script apart from so many movies. Cinematographer Giora Bejach continues the exemplary camera work during this curious segment that leaves us feeling somewhat uncertain at first.This family is stuck in the war that never ends. Like so many in the area, they carry burdens, guilt and grief that, like the war, also never ends. That first Act is transcendent filmmaking and acting, and the three acts work together as a prime example of the melding of visual and emotional storytelling. Most of the film takes place in one of two locales, and it's the subtleties in each shot that tell us what we must know.

Think 'Picnic at Hanging Rock,' but with a touch more paganism. It's pretty great.They Remain is, to my knowledge, the first cinematic adaptation of a Laird Barron story (this one being rooted in -30- from the Occultation short story collection), and it does a wonderful job of evoking the unsettling world-behind-the-world that is the persistent undercurrent of Barron's work. Readers of story might note that the setting has moved from a California desert to a chilly forest - a move I think really works to the film's advantage, letting the internal confusion of the characters manifest externally, and - importantly - providing an environment that feels ancient and alive, brimming with cycles of life and death, decomposition and rebirth. For me, at least, it gives it much more of a 'folk horror' atmosphere that I really connected with.Separating this film from other works adjacent to this stripe of dream-inflected natural Horror is the strong work by the two lead actors. They largely carry, and solidify, the narrative by skirting between both alienation and dependence, keeping the audience enthralled in the acrimony bubbling under the surface within the tight confines of the field research lab, as the ebb and flow of needing a home to come back to conflicts with the compulsion to taste the reckless freedom of just being lost in nature, and the price that is paid for both.It's a really excellent film that, for the right audience at least, is going to be a deeply compelling and unsettling experience.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Despite this impressive list of titles, \"They Remain\" is the first film to be adapted from Barron's work.In horror, there is something known as the \"slow burn\", a film that relies more on building a sense of tension and tone rather than a fast-paced scary, in-your-face gorefest. \"They Remain\" is definitely going for the slow burn method, though some might doubt whether it has been achieved. The film can fairly be described as \"minimalist\", and as such viewers may find there is very little actually burning. Does the thin plot pay off in the end? Because of its screening at a Lovecraft film festival, it seems appropriate to discuss any themes that might be Lovecraftian. And indeed, the idea of there being a connection between geography and madness is very much a Lovecraft-inspired topic. In fact, this may be the most interesting part of the film: is the cult a one-off, or is there something otherworldly that causes such behavior time and time again? And if the latter, what is the cause? Lovecraft dabbled with the ideas of non-Euclidean geometry affecting areas (architecture) and radioactive meteors altering moods. But what does \"They Remain\" offer? For the horror fans, there will likely be some disappointment with the average makeup effects, particularly the burn wounds in one scene. In other technical areas, the film excels. The framing, cinematography, score and so on are all top-notch. The acting is excellent, and the two leads successfully take a thin plot and carry the run time's weight.\"They Remain\" debuted October 7 at the H. P Lovecraft Film Festival.

Stanley Tucci (sporting a toupee that doesn't look half-bad) is as solid as ever as Ted Swenson, a dispirited college English lit professor in desperate search of a follow-up to a successful debut novel. Addison Timlin is Angela Argo, an admiring and enigmatic student who persuades her prof to critique chapters of her own go at a book. At first Angela projects as timid and unsure of herself and her craft with Ted. But we watch as she transforms from a seemingly scattered coed into a poised and purposeful young woman, and all the while shrewdly laser-focused on a prize she covets above all else. As the mentorship develops matters inevitably become increasingly complicated between teacher and student. Eventually the relationship makes a volatile shift from nurturing common bond to flashpoint cataclysmic intimacy. Screenplay writer and director Richard Levine presents a dynamic in which it becomes increasingly difficult to discern who is in fact playing whom in the quest for literary fame and fortune.The supporting cast are quite good across the board in \"Submission\". The multi-gifted Janeane Garofalo-one of my all-time faves-brings a sense of humor and pathos to the story as Magda, professional cohort and personal confidante of Ted who must help determine a wrenching verdict regarding her friend late in the film. The routinely reliable Kyra Sedgwick makes an impression as Sherrie, a dutifully supportive working wife who has her comfy world shaken upside down in the wake of devastating disclosure. The pivotal restaurant dinner scene between husband and wife is powerful stuff from both of these pros.

The film wishes to recall the musicals from Hollywood's classic era in a decidedly modern way. e.g. with mobile telephones.The premise is that Liliane (Huppert) was once a rising singer, whose stage name was Laura, until her marriage to her manager fell apart. Afterwards she withdrew into such obscurity that no one would guess a pate packer was once a rising star who represented France in the Eurovision song contest.Enter a young man, Jean, who is considerably younger than Lilian but who remembers Laura because his dad was a devotee and Jean knows all her songs. When he confronts Liliane she denies being Laura initially but eventually she admits her former existence. After a one-off performance for Jean's boxing club, Liliane - and Jean - find it hard to return Laura to obscurity and so begins a tale of desire, unlikely love and lost ambition.The story all makes sense when viewed through the eyes of a 1930's audience whose desire for wish fulfilment would be unconcerned with plausibility. To enjoy the film it helps to place realism to one side and follow fantasy and yearning especially when it beckons in the form of Huppert singing love songs with specific hand/arm choreography and costumed in resplendent dresses.Isabelle Huppert did her own singing to music from Pink Martini and lyrics co-written by the director and producer. Her moments on screen singing are some of the best. Is there nothing this woman cannot do? The best way to enjoy this film is when you need a tonic, a pick me up because life is being punchy.

It's easy to say now, due to the show's success has earned itself two local Logie Wins and Two Emmy Nominations overseas. Though due to the show's overall impact and worldwide cult following, I guess it was only a matter of time for the series creators, as well as the cast to eventually have some form of a reunion or continuation. The show itself boasted a vibrant Sydney setting involving colourful characters with depth and dimension and was able to take their youths seriously, especially when covering themes not often thought out well enough in other teen dramas.For Tara Webster (Xenia Goodwin) dancing was everything to her, until she had a suffered a spinal fracture in her final company audition. Despite making a full recovery she now passes her time working as a waitress at the Sydney Opera House. Although she fears she'll never dance again, the company's creative director Madeline Moncur (Miranda Otto) attempts to convince her to re-audtion. Now Tara is on quest to regain her strengths and talents taking us from Australia to America to see whether or not she has it in for dancing in the real world, reuniting with plenty of familiar faces along the way.I initially had a fear this film wouldn't work as well as it would. However, the gifted performers that have spent so much time as these characters in the series really made it work so incredibly well. It's a lot like reuniting with old school friends and thinking no time has ever passed by. While the series as a whole was about young dancers 'willing to prove their worth to the world'. This cinematic continuation which takes place 18 months after the characters have graduated from the Academy focuses on themes; 'whether or not the dreams of our youth are really relevant to us when we're older'. Looking at these characters now, Abigail Armstrong (Dena Kaplan) is a company principle dancer, Christian Reed (Jordan Rodriguez) teaches dance at a memorial hall named after the gang's deceased friend, Kat Karamakov (Alicia Banit) is a children's show host in New York, Ben 'Benster' Tickle (Thomas Lacey) is in the Austin Ballet and Ollie Lloyd (Keiynan Lonsdale) has traveled the world as a performer. The many paths these characters have taken just go to show how much of a difference they've gone their separate ways since their school days. It's only by some sense of their reluctance they're all able to eventually reunite. For Tara her determination is as great as ever, even when dealing with the difficulties of her relationships to possibly endangering her chances of rekindling her dream she worked so hard at. It's only when she realizes something different about circumstantial nature she must try to take up a different path in order to look ahead without any worry, not only about herself but for her friends who she deeply loves and cares for so much.Jeffery Walker, whose contributed to the TV series directed this film with such vibrancy it deliberately drops the soapy tone of the TV series in favour of a more kinky and glamorous feel that translates well to the big screen. The cinematography really gives a great and bigger sense to the production's upgrade being able to stand out more cinematically than it's Television predecessor. The film's choice of music even fits well to the lighthearted tone and endearing drama. Although if you have a montage sequence that doesn't involve dance it can pad the moment out a little too far than what's needed. Even when the film tries to break into Tara's subconsciousness portraying her fear that can also be a shift of the film's tonal aspect. I don't think the film is great, though in many ways it's very good and one of the better dance themed films to come out recently. It sometimes falters through some of the drama's more mundane clich\u00e9s than expected, though it quality is maintained thanks to Joanna Werner and Samantha Strauss's screenplay.Overall, I was deeply satisfied with this film. I had a smile on my face upon leaving the cinema knowing full well It's a film that's entertaining as it's endearing and incredibly worthy as a continuation to the TV Series that offers quality drama and entertainment to fans and non-fans alike. I don't think it'll be the type of award winning material for Australian films this year though it's safe to recommend it to the family crowed as one of this year's more entertaining Australian films.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The Australian setting gave the original series something different, moving it to NYC made it just another mediocre dance movie (ironically, something that the lead characters complain about in the TV series repeatedly). Coupled with the jarring move to NYC, was the unrealistic portrayal of Kat getting a job on a kids show. Not only are cheap kids shows NOT made in NYC (they're made in CA), but the recently discovered star of a cable show wouldn't make enough money for a fancy New York apartment and a hot pink limo. Thirdly, you've already killed Sammy off the show. There was no need to bring back Ben's cancer. It was needless drama.Fourth, why put Tara through the ringer of auditioning, not getting the part, moving to NYC, repeatedly auditioning and not getting the part, only to get picked up by the Australian company that rejected her in the first place... only to have her quit dancing after all of that? And we all know that Abigail isn't going to throw away her place in the company to dance an amateur's choreography in a one time showcase.Overall, the characters were all written very differently than their previous selves in the TV series.

Look, I'll admit: I've never read the book (shame on me, I guess, as a lifelong lover of SF and general metaphysical weirdness), so I can't judge \nDuVernay's \"A Wrinkle In Time\" as an adaptation of L'Engle's literary favorite. But I CAN measure it as a film that wants to tell a story, and on that scale...um......Uy.

Good performers are wasted on one-note characters (be they whimsical space-nymphs or oh-so-precious baby geniuses) in puzzling costumes and -- were those hairdos? I think they were hairdos. I mean, they were where hair is supposed to be. Expensive FX fill the screen in service to a plot that *drifts* through its paces instead of *advancing*. If there was variance in the musical score, I missed it (but I think I didn't, because I think there wasn't). Michael Pe\u00f1a is asked to leave his \"Ant-Man\" charm at home and put on a goofy mustache and some red contacts for like a few minutes, and Captain Kirk (the new one, anyway) has a beard and is interesting, but doesn't really do anything and OPE what nope I'm awake not snoring sorry no.This is going to be someone's favorite movie, and that's a beautiful thing; art needn't be categorically *good* to be *effective*, after all, and I love the hell out of \"Xanadu\", so I should know.

However, I also kept saying \"I hope Disney doesn't screw this up again,\" after the travesty TV version they made in the early 2000s.Lo and behold, they managed to screw it up again.Let's start with the few bright spots (and calling them bright spots is even generous). First, I did enjoy the visual depiction of the tesseract. Also, the casting was pretty good. Storm Reid was well cast as Meg, and Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which were also portrayed well, despite that they drastically downplayed Mrs. Which's character.Now, the bad (and there is a lot of bad). Mrs. Whatsit was changed into a completely negative character who seemed completely inept and pessimistic. Important points in the book (Ixiel and Aunt Beast, for example) were completely ignored and given only cursory mentions so fleeting that you barely even notice it.\nThe Man with Red Eyes is turned into marionette who literally collapses on screen. I get that in the novel he was a \"puppet\" of IT, but the depiction in the movie was laughable.\nThe ridiculous storm scene when they first arrive on Camazotz came out of nowhere and was so ridiculously portrayed. First, they're struggling to find Charles Wallace, then they go through this ridiculous storm sequence, and when they make it over this wall (which again, was nowhere in the source material), that concern for Charles Wallace is completely gone until he pops out of nowhere saying \"here I am.\" And are Meg and Calvin relieved to see him? Nope. It's more like \"meh, okay.\"\nThe movie completely left out how Calvin and Dr. Murray got back from Camazotz. All of a sudden, they're just back. Poof, no explanation.I get that certain stories require work to adapt: I didn't get particularly outraged with some of the changes \"Prince Caspian\" and \"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" made in the Narnia series because those were short novels whose structure required adaption to make them cinematic. I wasn't necessarily pleased with all of them, but given the structure of the books, it was understandable that some work had to be done.\n\"A Wrinkle in Time\" was different. It's a very linear story which already was very cinematic and could easily translate itself from page to screen.

They are my favorite subgenre of horror films. I'd much rather see one of the Friday the 13th sequels than a bleak, depressing horror film. The original Strangers was a good film. It was creepy and very bleak. It's not a film I can rewatch often because it is so downbeat. This sequel is one that I could rewatch over and over again. Probably as many times as I have seen Friday the 13th part 2. It's just an all around fun slasher flick. It's not near as scary as the original but I found it to be miles more entertaining. The actors all did a good job and I liked the characters and was rooting for them to survive throughout the film despite some of the dumb decisions that some of the characters made. But ALL horror films have characters making dumb decisions. One of the classics is Evil Dead which features a character walking into the woods in the middle of the night because she hears someone calling her name.

To date, it stands as the most taut moviegoing experience of my life. After nearly a decade of production hell, the sequel-\"The Strangers: Prey at Night\" has finally come out of the woodwork. This followup has the same trio of villains pursuing victims in cat-and-mouse games, but this time it's an entire family staying at a deserted resort who are the target.Perhaps I'm biased because I truly love the original film, but I found \"Prey at Night\" to be a significant letdown as a followup to Bryan Bertino's 2008 film, which was a masterful exercise in tension. I was skeptical of a sequel even being possible given how well Bertino exercised his formula in the first film-what else could really be done? \"Prey at Night\" essentially takes the formula of the first film, dresses it in de rigeur '80s style (complete with an exclusive '80s soundtrack), and amplifies the gore. It's mostly in good fun-but it's also completely devoid of suspense, tension, and unease. There are a few sequences that are masterfully-executed-including a protracted sequence in a neon-lit swimming pool, and a mother-daughter attack in a trailer- but the in-between that stitches these better scenes together is repetitive and predictable, and the cinematography often gives the feel of a made-for-TV movie. The characters are also an issue in that they feel too much like stock characters; the lead being a chain-smoking bratty teenage girl running around in a Ramones t-shirt, followed by her likable brother, and two hip parents who are in the process of carting little-miss-trouble off to boarding school. In spite of the contrived characters, the acting is fairly good from all involved, including the actors portraying the three strangers.There are a few moments of true tragedy and true catharsis in the film which are well-orchestrated, but I cannot help but compare \"Prey at Night\" to its predecessor. This sequel is a very different film that has its hits, but it frankly has more misses. As a frivolous run-of-the-mill slasher, it's rather enjoyable, but it lacks the emotional gravitas that made the first film so arresting and nerve-shredding. 5/10.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt1285009", "movieTitle": "The Strangers: Prey at Night", "title": "An idiotic horror sequel", "author": "capaldimark", "postedDate": "8 March 2018", "reviewContent": "In 2008 a movie called \"The Strangers\" was released, which, in my opinion, is one of the best horror movies of recent times, mainly because of its simplicity and its eerie realism. So here we are, a decade later, with the release of its sequel, titled \"The Strangers: Prey At Night\", directed by Johannes Roberts. Given the success of the first installment, it's fair to assume that this sequel comes with a lot of hype even after all these years. Unfortunately, not only does \"Prey At Night\" not live up to the hype, it comes up far short of it. \nPrey At Night's plot will be familiar to anyone that has seen the first movie. A family decides to go away for the weekend and stay at a trailer park where some family members live at. Soon after they arrive, they get a knock from a mysterious girl who is seemingly lost. After she leaves, the family begins noticing strange things and soon encounter three masked people trying to hunt down and kill them. Again, it's a story that will be familiar to anyone that has seen the original, but this time it's a family of four trying to survive in a trailer park seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Because it's set in the confines of a trailer park and not a house like in the original, there's a lot more room for the family to move around and escape from these masked killers. Ultimately, in this case, that ends up being a bad thing. What really made the original as eerie and intense as it was is how condensed the atmosphere was. It was two people essentially trapped in an isolated house with nothing else around them while being stalked and preyed upon by three unknown, masked people. It really added to the chill that you felt by watching it knowing that there is a bit of realism that is present in the situation. It was simple but very effective in how it delivered its scares. Here, it's different. It's a much more open and less suffocating atmosphere and as a result, you lose a lot of the tenseness and eeriness that existed in the original. What I'm trying to say here is that this movie is not very scary. It has its moments here and there, but the constant feeling of dread that was in the original is unfortunately absent here due to the structure of the environment.\nAnother element of the original that makes it better is the performances. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman really made you feel like they were in grave danger, which added to the overall feeling of dread. In this sequel, the acting isn't quite as good. It's still an \"okay\" cast made up of Christina Hendricks, Martin Henderson, Bailee Madison (probably the standout here), and Lewis Pullman, but they're just not quite up to par with Tyler and Speedman, both being pretty good actors. To be fair, however, the characters and writing didn't necessarily do this new cast any justice. Multiple times throughout the movie these people would do idiotic things that would get them into trouble. If I had a nickel for every time I wanted to facepalm, I'd probably have enough to easily cover my ticket for the movie. And don't even get me started on the last 15 minutes. Most of the things that happen in the final 15 minutes is either so idiotic that I could barely watch, or not even humanly possible. It's all just a bunch of nonsense that tries to set up a sequel, but fails miserably. \nThe film's runtime is 85 minutes, which is pretty short for a mainstream movie these days. It ends up being a good thing though, as the movie doesn't waste much time getting straight to the action. Instead of a drawn out, overlong horror flick, it ends up being pretty well paced, which is one of the few things that it actually gets right. \nOverall, what we have here is a horror sequel that pales in comparison in every way to the original. It tries to be as scary and thrilling as the original, but what the original had was simplicity and realism, which created a constant feeling of dread, something that this movie fails to deliver even in its best moments. Here's hoping that it takes them 10 years to deliver another sequel.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Last year's GEOSTORM was a \"B\" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - \"Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!\"). Unfortunately, a \"C\" example of this is THE HURRICANE HEIST.Directed by Rob Cohen - who brought us the original FAST AND FURIOUS film lo' those many years ago - THE HURRICANE HEIST tells the tale of a HEIST set during a...anyone?...HURRICANE. That's pretty much all you need to know of the plot. The rest is action, escapes, weather gone bad, bad guys being bad guys and good guys being good guys.The good guys are Toby Kebbel (so good as the motion capture bad-guy ape in DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES), perennial \"B\"-movie actress Maggie Grace (TAKEN, LOST and the immortal HOT GIRL, FAST CAR, EATING A BANANA) and Ryan Kwanten (I guess he was in TRUE BLOOD). What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.The bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial \"that guy\" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of \"red shirts\". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a \"that guy\" and the \"red shirts\" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the \"loose cannon\" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.Oh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)?

Rob Cohen made this morally recommended real disaster master piece. Any bad disaster film is just to show disaster game which does not focus on conflicts among human protagonist and antagonists.This category 5 hurricane is just a narrative device like zombies in George Romero's Dead series. True disaster film tells human conflicts under disaster not the monster-like disastrous phenomena itself.We can say shark is not the antagonist of JAWS (1975) but the mayer and the entourage are the true antagonists in the human conflict. This is the correct point of view in terms of story telling. The Hurricane Heist mainly describes the heist related conflict among the U.S. Treasury officers and corrupted local police men during category 5 hurricane mess. Main drama is the Die Hard-like heist incident not the monster hurricane. I can say that Armageddon(1998), Deep Impact (1998), Twister (1996) are just disaster games rather than serious human conflicts. This hurricane is equal with fictional function of any monsters in filmmaking. All of them are not antagonists but are devices to express human conflicts among human characters. Any defect of humanity is lack of true drama. The Hurricane Heist makes us realise what true antagonist should be. Besides this important structural achievement, we also can not ignore clear cinematic refrain among tight sequences in the end of Act 2 to Act 3 which are chase scenes from the federal bank to the highway with category 5 hurricane threatens them from their behind. The corrupted policemen and Perkins' decision to betray their duty, Will and Casey's decision to be loyal to their duty are perfectly and consciously contrasted in the story structure. Decision making is the nature of plot and it embodies meaning of subtext in the entire cinematic expressions. Moreover, this decision making is finally refrained after the escape from the hurricane. The protagonists, Will and Casey don't make a kind of decision to steal the federal bank money when they can do it like the failed villains. This is the structure. The screen writer highly conscious about the plotting that express meaning of entire context clearly. \nI was really impressed with this quality work among other genre films in 2018!

{"imdbId": "tt3721964", "movieTitle": "Gringo", "title": "This Gringo was not the Heffe", "author": "rgkarim", "postedDate": "10 March 2018", "reviewContent": "Dark-Comedies are an acquired taste, but once you develop it you have the ability to appreciate more satirical comedy. David Oyelowo attempts to bring this genre to life this weekend in the movie Gringo, a film that has some bite I didn't expect from a movie this early in the year. But what zany adventures will unfold when a black man is stuck between the high stakes world of pharmaceutical development and the cartels? Well that is what this film attempts to answer, and it is my job to give you the 411 on the latest movies to storm the screen. Let's go!LIKES:-David Oyelowo Acting\n-Morale dilemma\n-Funny at times\n-Fast-Paced Gringo is a movie that likes to go over the top, with characters that are all about going to one extreme or the other. However David Oyelowo is the character that has a little more dynamic than the other. Oyelowo is fun to watch, for me being the funniest character with his loud, rambunctious delivery of lines that are loaded with high-pitched panicking screams. Yet he is able to turn that energy around, and focus it to give a character that is worth looking into as he tries to navigate the hostile world he wound up in. Like his character Harold, Oyelowo keeps things very relatable and invests his time to making a good adventure. \n But what is an adventure without a little ethics debate to come into the light. Gringo does this just right as the conversation of doing the right thing vs. the selfish thing constantly rears its ugly head in the cartel wastelands that this film takes place in. Harold's journey not only tests his own morals, but inspires others to address their own life choices, from settling on abusive boyfriends to what one will do to get money to accomplish their personal goals. It fits okay into the movie, but there are some hard hitting dialogue moments to help reassure that the best stuff doesn't mean the best life. \n As stated earlier, dark comedies are a little dryer than other, more modern comedies so you have to be ready for more delivery and timing to do the lifting. Gringo has some legit comedic moments, really taking an awkward situation and turning it into a tear inducing riot of laughs. These moments often have a nice, clever zing to them, that Oyelowo maximizes using his natural accent and mannerisms.\n And all of these components are able to be placed in a decently paced run time that minimizes the slow and maximizes the thrills. DISLIKES: -Curse heavy dialogue\n-Not as funny as I had hoped\n-Much ruined by trailers\n-A little chaotic at the end You've read my reviews, but you know that lazy writing that relies of cursing doesn't get my stamp of approval. Gringo has extreme characters that don't use the most advanced language, relying once more on F-bombs and sleazy pick up lines to do the talking. While pertinent to the story, for once, and sometimes entertaining, Gringo utilized these tactics too much for my tastes. Even the yelling of Oyelowo got old, with many of his pleas soon running dry like the desert he ran through. As such, this movie didn't really have the comedic punch I wanted, but more a thrill seeking, dark adventure with a little comedic buff thrown in. Perhaps this is also due to the fact that a lot of the funny parts had been advertised to death in the trailers, resulting in the overplayed scene being boring by show time. And once the last scene started to end and all the stories came together, things sort of wrapped up in a chaotic package that wasn't in time with the movie. Not the worst mind you, but not what I quite expected from the trailers. \nThe VERDICT:  Gringo is okay, and designed for a select audience that wants the darker things in life to be ridiculed. This film is a legitimate mixture of drama, crime, adventure and comedy, taking these aspects and twisting it into a semi-entertaining story with some moral obligations to address. While I enjoyed Oyelowo and the well-timed zingers, I still can't say this was the best, most unique comedy to hit the screen. The extreme characters, mundane dialog, and chaotic organization (ruined by the trailers), didn't deliver the expected feel I got from the advertising and as such left more to be desired. So I recommend skipping this one and hitting something else in the month of March. My scores are: Action/Comedy/Crime: 7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.0", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

If you want to call him a good man that wants to do the right thing and please everybody then you can call him that. If you want to call him a sap that is ninja level naive then I would say that's a better description. He is so trusting and naive it's nauseating. The company he works for is involved in some illegal dealings and things go awry when he and his superiors go to Mexico.To put it simply: I wasn't feeling this movie, not even from the beginning. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is it an action? Is it a crime mystery? I was lost hence I didn't know how to treat the movie. One thing it wasn't, it wasn't good. It was full of hyperbole characters that you were supposed to love or hate: I hated them all--including the main character. Harold was so gullible he bordered on special needs. His boss, Richard, possessed every trait that you'd hate in a person which made him uber-unlikeable. His boss's partner, Elaine, had an ambiguous role in the movie but she certainly was a living, breathing setback for the #metoo movement. And Harold's wife, Bonnie, seemed to be in the movie only to complete the picture of how naive and pathetic Harold was. The plot was not much better than the characters. It was a David and Goliath/Little Engine that Could/Underdog story that wasn't told any better than the millions of movies with such a plot before it. I think if the movie went all out comedy it would have been so much better. They were already using caricatures for the characters and there were a few funny scenes so they should have gone even more extreme with it and then we'd have something. But instead they were stuck somewhere between \"to be funny or not to be funny? That is the question.\" So they just failed.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Xavier, Esq.Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a spoiled, rich kid in Connecticut, living the good life at home with her mother and step-dad Mark (Paul Sparks). When her former friend Amanda (Olivia Cooke), a social misfit, is in need of tutoring for college entrance exams, the two girls rekindle their friendship and bond over their shared dislike of Lily's step-dad. Unfortunately, Mark blindsides Lily by threatening to send her to a boarding school far from home, and the girls decide to take matters into their own hands, with disastrous results.Thoroughbreds is clearly a masterpiece - even when it reveals the disgusting viscera which lies beneath the most attractive human beings. Is \"pretty\" only something we wear? Is \"good\" a thing we can see? Do the good guys always wear white? Or is our civility really a mask that we put on and remove at will? Cooke as Amanda clearly and expertly challenges our perceptions as the token sociopath, while Anton Yelchin, in his final screen performance as Tim, rounds out the roster of deplorable characters as a statutory rapist and drug-czar-to-teenagers.But wait - just when you think you know the direction writer-director Cory Finley wants to take us, the plot shifts, and the true monster is revealed. Cooke and Taylor-Joy shine throughout this lushly filmed nightmare as privileged girls who refuse to succumb to the banality of their exclusive lifestyle. Their acting is effortless and convincing, which makes this story all the more insidious.

{"imdbId": "tt5649108", "movieTitle": "Thoroughbreds", "title": "devilishly clever", "author": "David Ferguson", "postedDate": "9 March 2018", "reviewContent": "Greetings again from the darkness. Each year provides us with (at least) a few hidden gems sprinkled amongst the superheroes and newfangled special effects displays, and although this feature film debut from filmmaker Cory Finley is only now hitting theatres, it seems safe to say it likely won't draw the size audience it deserves. If you enjoy dark, twisted, and devilishly clever films, you owe it to yourself to track down this one.Olivia Cooke (ME AND EARLY AND THE DYING GIRL) stars as Amanda, someone who walks a miniscule line between neurotic and psychopath. The startling and quite ominous opening features Amanda, a horse, and a large knife. Next, and some time later, we see Amanda re-connecting with her childhood friend and boarding school brainiac Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy, SPLIT and THE WITCH) in what appears to be a tutoring session being held in the palatial estate where Lily lives with her mother and \"evil\" stepdad Mark (Paul Sparks).What follows is the mind-bending, winding-road of us attempting to fit either or both of these characters into some \"normal\" category of human behavior. Instead, what lies beneath is slowly unsheathed. As Amanda and Lily interact, we especially come to realize that Amanda is drawing out what's behind the proper front that Lily wears on a daily basis. A plot to murder the stepdad is developed, and caught in the wicked web is Anton Yelchin as Tim, a dreamer and schemer who quickly realizes the trouble these two bring. This was one of the last roles Yelchin filmed before his tragic death. His brief time on screen here reminds us of his immense talent.An atmosphere of dread and pending doom hovers over most every scene, yet somehow it's simultaneously funny and disturbing. We find ourselves asking if it's OK to laugh at some of the exchanges. As Amanda explains she's \"not a bad person\", the line makes us chuckle, while also making us realize she actually believes it and we shouldn't! As she teaches her tutor Lily \"the technique\", we become convinced the line has been crossed into psychopathy. Suburban Connecticut and its corresponding privileged life has rarely generated more queasy feelings, and with our hope for humanity in the balance, we watch Amanda and Lily bounce from plotting to problem solving and from conspiring to collaborating. The absence of empathy goes beyond disconcerting and into a feeling of resolved fear. The lack of emotions and empathy can be more frightening than vampires or fictional monsters.Cinematographer Lyle Vincent does nice work displaying this world, and he will always deserve a mention after his sterling work on 2014's A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT. The dark, twisted work is well accompanied by the abrupt and jarring music, and filmmaker Finley deserves recognition for crafting this creepy corner of a universe none of us want to join. His film is in the vein of something Yorgos Lanthimos (THE LOBSTER) might deliver, and that's quite high praise for oddity ... in fact, Odin Impetus Lowe even gets a screen credit, and he's the opening scene horse!", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Director Cory Finley (primarily a writer) presents an engaging Chapter oriented thriller set in the upper class suburban neighborhood of Connecticut. Estranged grammar school friend Lily (Any Taylor-Joy \"\"Split\" 2016) is hired to tutor troubled and discounted Amanda (Olivia Cooke \"Me and Earl and Dying Girl\" 2015). When Amanda opens Lily's eye's to her less than favorable family surroundings, specifically her overbearing father Mark (the amazing Paul Sparks from \"Boardwalk Empire\") and weak mother Francie Swift (Tv's \"Outsiders\"), the two take it upon themselves to remedy the situation. Enter Tim (Anton Yelchin \"Star Trek\"- in his final role before his recent death), a loser who regretfully becomes involved with the girls. The suspense in this film comes from the quiet writing and directing style Finley presents, along with a very effective eerie and calculating score by Erik Freidlander. While the film has a tendency to move slow at times, it only enhances the suspense. Taylor-Joy, with her perfect hair, complexion and wardrobe, is terrific as the upper class kid, where Cooke (with her unemotional gaze and distraught appearance) looks right through all she comes in contact with, and Yelchin embodies all things loser. \"Thoroughbreds\" is set to open in theatres in March 2018.

It translates to: \"Smouldering remembrance\" (there surely will be better translations, even more meeting the movie's true content).The movie is an emotional journey about an old couple that's been married for half a century. He once was a literate English teacher and she's been giving birth to two beloved children, who have their own families by now.The old couple's live has reached their final stage: He's suffering from Alzheimer disease and she's suffering from cancer. So they spontaneously decide to go on their last big trip, from Boston to Key West, to meet his lifetime wish of having visited The Ernest Hemingway Home once in his life - without telling their kids, who get anxiously concerned when they realize that their parents are not at home as they expected them to be.The trip that the old couple takes is a truely heart-warming story through their past. They take their old Winnebago and head out for Key West, revisiting not only the old camp sites they visited so often before but also revisiting stages of their life and their family, being aware that this will be the last big trip they will ever have together again.His dementia gives room for some funny moments but also for some truely sad. She attends him the best she can, but when they go back through their life, watching old slides on improvised personal slide shows they watch at their camp site stops, it's heartbreaking to realize that she will be losing him.The movie is a great emotional roller coaster ride of a beloved couple, of loving and anxious children and how our life may be like when it will have reached its final chapter.The movie is a so-called chick flick. Be prepared to have handkerchieves near at hand when watching it.Me and my girl friend had quite a few tears dropped while watching the movie. It may have affected us more than other viewers because it kind of reflected our life. We are about 50 years old and had a similar life, taking camping trips in an old Jeep Wrangler on our journeys to Italy. To be in the picture of the movie: I'm the demential (former?) literate driver, and she (who's even more literate) tells me where to head to and, whenever she can, she attends me so nicely (or tells me where to put it). We are laughing, talking, quarreling, and we get emotional ... So we felt very much like that old couple. (Well, at least I did. My girl friend felt with the old couple on their own.) ...

The entire audience, composed of young and old people, laughed aloud and applauded often throughout the film. Why? Because the topic, situations presented, and dialogue resonated with experiences common to the lives of everyone watching.The film addresses topics not often seen in films: intimate loving relationships and romance in the elderly, Alzheimer's, end-of-life issues and family dynamics involved, dying with dignity, personal choice, euthanasia and suicide. There is no preachiness; the viewers are respectfully left with an emotional invitation to reflect upon these issues for themselves. Remarkably, this is done with humour and grace, without self pity or undue sentimentality.\n \nThe film is not Hollywood glitzy, it may even seem a bit drab at times, but this is part of why it rings true and makes the film work. Everything from the couple's home and basement, the RV they run off in, the campgrounds they stay in, and the nursing home they visit - all of it, remarkably familiar to most Americans. We are being asked to think about extraordinary issues relating to ordinary lives, similar to those we all lead, and it seems that this less glossy calling card works. This approach is also supported by the beautifully nuanced performances given by Mirren and Southerland as they let us into their world of romance, aging, family, incurable illness, and end-of-life choices, all while travelling the landscape of US Route #1.From start to closing credits, group laughter, applause, and cheering revealed a palpable comradery among the audience members, which told volumes about how well the film accomplished its goal of raising awareness of important emotional, personal, social issues while still offerring an enjoyable night at the movies.

I should also emphasize now, though, that \"The Leisure Seeker\" also tries to find the humor in this inherently sad situation, and succeeds at times: There are some very amusing moments. In an interview while promoting this film Helen Mirren said she took the role because the character she was playing was rushing into living and life rather than running away from it when it got difficult, and I agree. Interesting to find out in the closing credits that this is an Italian film production, with an Italian director (in fact, Mirren also said she always wanted to be in an Italian film because they were so inspiring to her when she was young, and it was also one of the reasons she took this role), so it is actually an Italian take on a very American story and road trip taking place in two distinctly different parts of America along the East Coast, from Massachusetts to Florida. I found it reflective and contemplative in a good way, and I was drawn in and glad I took the trip with them, even if I left the theater feeling melancholy and a bit afraid of what my later years may bring to me as well.

The man that this is about is already mentioned in the title and seeing his OBE it seems he is far more known in the UK than here and this one runs for 1.5 hours approximately. The director is Thomas Riedelsheimer, a prolific filmmaker that I have not come across so far yet I think, also a prolific cinematographer. His presence explains the German aspect of this documentary. I see this is not the first occasion Goldsworthy and Riedelsheimer worked together, so it is some sort of reunion. Now as for the film itself, I think there are quite a few moments of beauty in here to an extent where I would want to say that this is much better seeing on the big screen, not the small screen. The yellow leaf scenes are a revelation to be honest, but you can give all kinds of approaches to the different scenes. I for example very much liked the several parts where we see him lie on the ground in the rain and then quickly move away and we see how the water pours down there and nature gets it back for itself. Then of course the scenes of alternative movement (lets call it that). When he pushes forward through the hedge for example with the other people just walking on the sidewalk, it more had something funny to me instead of something inspired, even if I can definitely see the alternate and interesting thinking approach behind that idea. I guess it is all up to your very personal self and character which parts you like the most. But there is no denying that this is a really inspiring and inspired film that will certainly go way more under the radar than it should. It profits a lot from its likable protagonist and I also liked the personal note it gets with his daughter assisting him. I must say that in terms of nature I am more on the animal-interested site than about plants, but what he does here with leaves, trees, water etc. felt very impressive. There is also an effortless simplicity to the film. It shows art as something so simple and easy to achieve, even next to your place in the city and without many assets or instruments, but the nature, the streets and so on are already enough to come up with something that oozes depth and meaningfulness. This is a definite contender for best documentary of 2017 for me and I have a feeling I will watch it again at some point in the near future. Somehow this film made quite an impact on me and I certainly recommend checking it out. This is one you don't want to miss out especially if you got the chance to see it on the big screen.

The screenwriters ignored all the great characters that were in the game that would have brought this to life, they ignored the fact that a ship needs a crew (ridiculous point number one: one person manning an entire ship), they ignored the entire Trinity aspect of the game, they ignored all the good puzzle solving techniques, they ignored the fact that Lara was wealthy and trained herself in martial arts and weapons.This movie starts out with Lara sparring and she is awful at fighting. Why? Why would you make her awful at fighting when that is the entire basis of the Tomb Raider series - that she can fight and is a strong woman who can defend herself. They have three teenage boys basically frighten her off - so she is afraid of three teenagers, but minutes later is hitting everyone (trained mercs) with a bow.

She can swim against impassible currents but struggles to do a pull up at several points in the movie. Her skill with a bow rivals every man with a machine gun that she encounters. Every side character in the movie only serves to move Lara forward in her mission. Most of the characters were completely flat and did not change from the beginning of the movie to the end. Lara was always adventurous and brave. The villain was always hellbent on destruction and gaining control of the disease.Then, script: The script was heinous.

{"imdbId": "tt1365519", "movieTitle": "Tomb Raider", "title": "A nice reboot of the iconic video game character's movie", "author": "mikenontonmulu", "postedDate": "8 March 2018", "reviewContent": "At first when I found out about the reboot of this iconic video game character movie, I admit that I had my doubts when they cast Alicia Vikander to play Lara Croft. My doubt was due to the her prior experience of mostly having dramatic roles rather than action role. It would really require a great physical attributes in order to play this heroine who was famous for her agility and ability to run and jump through a whole lot of dangerous places like in the video game. But it turned out my doubt was completely unwarranted. Alicia Vikander truly deserves the praise for being a new action star and she was really great in playing this role. There were soo many action sequences that required her to do all those stuff and what surprised and amazed me was the fact that she did all of her stunts. This movie's main attraction was definitely all those wonderful action sequence. The plot/story line might not have been appealing to the movie critics as I also found it a bit weak. But that was not the point anyway. When we go to see Tomb Raider, the first thing that comes to people's mind would be lots of actions. The final third of the movie did not disappoint at all. Though I personally felt that the first half was not full of those. But whenever there were actions involved, they were always suspenseful and intense (my most favorite part would be when Lara was going through the jungle and waterfall until finally went to the ground). In here the movie focused on Lara Croft's early days. Which means the movie was more of an origin story of Lara Croft. This was a nice different approach by the film makers. It was also rather a surprise that the movie was not directed by Hollywood's more well known action director. The director was Roar Uthaug, a Norwegian film maker whose prior experience were directing Norwegian films. But I personally think he did wonderful job on the action sequences.As for other aspects like the sound effects, it was definitely great. The musical effect though not too good to my opinion (sometimes there was too much volume in certain scene which I think was to give more dramatic effect but felt unnecessary to my opinion). The special effects were good, and the CGI was done neatly & nicely. There were also few dramatic moments where my wife was also affected a bit. Oh there was also a brief fun appearance from Nick Frost. The other supporting characters in the movie that stood out was obviously Walter Goggins (as usual truly nailed it as a villain). The rest were OK, but sadly Daniel Wu's character was not really that great in here (not clear on whether he was supposed to be Lara's sidekick or what). The movie did not have middle or post end-credit scene, so you can relief yourself to the restroom if you have been holding off during the almost 2 hours duration of the movie. Overall, this movie was a nice reboot of Lara Croft. Do not overthink the plot or the sometimes not really logical part like how Lara was so strong & very good in doing all those stunts despite not having the proper training. Go to this movie to be entertained by the amazing action sequence (even if Lara seemed to be always very lucky like what my wife said). If you enjoy this kind of movie or if you are a fan of Tomb Raider games, then I think it would be satisfying. But if you want to see a lot of the tomb raiding scenes like in the previous Tomb Raiders movies, or if you are looking for the Indiana Jones quality, then this might not be too fulfilling. for my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

What this movie feels like, is pandering to the \"Lara Croft\" name, it adds nothing new, in terms of the Tomb Raider Mythology or any action movie in general. The script is generic, boring and predictable. The entire cinema actually scoffed at a line close to the end, during a scene which was supposed to be dramatic, but came off as fake and unusual. The characters' motivations were never fully explained, including Lu Ren, who flips between \"this trip is suicide there is nothing that can make me go\" to risking his boat and his life for \u00a31000 within a 30 second scene. The characters themselves seemed entirely one dimensional, there is a scene early on with Lara sharing eye contact with a female which hints at an affection as it lingers for slightly too long, which would have been a really interesting thread for a 21st century twist on her sexuality, but that character is never seen or mentioned again in the film. The \"mythology\" side of the story I enjoyed, while it was more grounded than the previous movies or games, this wasn't a bad thing. Alicia Vikander looks the part, certainly, Daniel Wu is passable, and Walton Goggins, for his credit, is fine. All of which are compliments, because the script is written in such a way that no characters are really able to show depth or development. \nI think my biggest issue with this film is how stupid almost every single character is. Without going into spoilers, there are moments particularly in the final third which baffled me. Why, when trying to kill someone, would you not use a gun? Why, turn back on yourself? Why? Why? Why? The CGI is average, passable in the darker scenes but jarring in the daylight. Action set pieces are few and far between and the plot starts well, but by half way through drags and could do with being 20 minutes shorter at least.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

But I'm holding that back to talk about how the film is, as a film. It's not worth giving every movie with a positive message and cute moments a 10/10. Film doesn't work like that. By this logic Geostorm is a godsend of a movie. And we all know how that went.Let's go with the good. I think that yes, this movie is quite cute. Most of the dialogue is pretty great. Even the emotional moments toward the end are pretty good. The actors have a lot to work with, and aside from some moments that don't work, they try a good amount. It's interesting to see how the world is fairly similar to the real world, with believable dialogue and predictable teenage behavior.I think the message of the movie is nice. Being gay is totally fine, and seeing this kid grow throughout the course of the movie is fitting. He's just an average guy, a little shy, and gay, but hasn't told anyone yet. So he just goes through life, staying with his friends, being himself. There's some good moments in here that fit, and the coming out scenes are handled very well. The ending is extremely adorable as well. I won't say anything specific, but bring tissues if you are not strong willed.That being said, despite how I like the acting, the dialogue, and the message... I think this movie has a lot of horrible cliche stuff that just doesn't work at all. The leads are romantically involved, but they aren't gonna say anything about it. The kids all hang out in Drama class. The one guy threatens to leak information if he doesn't get the girl with the help of the lead. Does it sound like I'm describing Love, Simon? Or am I describing every high school rom-com you've ever seen? Really the only twist here is the lead is gay and it seems the rest aren't. I dunno, halfway through it felt like the girl who secretly liked Simon was actually gay too.The bully characters- they're not even characters. They have maybe 5 lines. And they're only there to be the \"homophobic anchors\" and pull off one really obnoxious scene where the kind and understanding Drama teacher (of course it was the Drama teacher) roasts them in front of the whole school. They're not even offensive, if I saw \"bullies\" like that at my school I'd just laugh at them, not with them. They get roasted every time they make an offensive joke anyways. You could literally take them out and *nothing* would change. It's just another cliche that doesn't need to be there.The \"antagonist\" is really really dumb. He just accidentally stumbles across Simon's conversations and uses it as blackmail. He does realize that being gay is a touchy subject right? He has no real consideration, doesn't even hesitate when blackmailing. The movie treats him as pure evil with one goal: to get someone to like him. A special someone... could this get any cheesier? I think if I sprayed cheese over the screen it'd still not be as cheesy. Really? This is yandare at it's finest, except when she denies him. Like he does everything right and she says no. So what does he do? Leaks the emails! Take your rage out on the guy who was only trying to help you win! Really??? Like Simon gave him the advice, he took it, and when she says no, he just does something so inconsiderate and bad you can't understand what he was thinking. Simon had nothing to do with some other girl saying no to you. Don't take it out on him... he's the Baby Driver himself. (Really look at the two... jeez...)So yes, this movie is fine. It's not nearly as good as everyone is praising it as, at least to me. I think there are parts that are extremely great, and parts that are absolutely awful. If you can look past some of the cliches and fully immerse yourself in the movie, and the good stuff about it, good on you. You absolutely have the right to enjoy it and love it.

The film is based on real events of the hijacking of a passenger plane in 1976. The main character are the German hijackers portrayed by Daniel Br\u00fchl and Rosamund Pike. It is obvious that the director tried to evoke sympathy of the viewers towards the terrorists and to somehow explain their actions.Daniel Br\u00fchl with his kind smile and positive charisma seemed out of place in the film. At the press conference Daniel said that it was important for him that his protagonist did not kill the passengers. However the fact that man did not kill the hostages does not alleviate the criminality of his deed. The terrorists hijacked the plane and only by miracle the airplane did not suffer a catastrophe which would have killed all the passengers aboard. These actions of the terrorists are the gravest crime which cannot be justified in any way. Any attempt to explain and to humanize the criminals are in my point of view are disgusting. The director tried to compare the actions of the Israeli army and the actions of terrorists. However terrorism concerning peaceful citizens, as with the hijacking, no matter which country is involved, is not justifiable.The film is made in an ordinary, pseudo-documentary fashion, with some shaky-cam footage. However that such charismatic actors such as Daniel Br\u00fchl and Rosamund Pike played the terrorists made the film unbelievable and stupid. The dance sequences were non-organically integrated into the film.At the press-conference the director said that he did not want to depicted the terrorists as zombies, he wanted to show their humanity. Nevertheless, it is a dangerous statement - many terrorists are in fact zombified, they are brainwashed and make horrible deeds against innocent people, under the influence of completely absurd ideas. With this they do lose their humanity, and there is nothing wrong in depicting them as brainwashed.In modern times terrorism only continues to become more widespread, and in this situation any hint of compassion towards those who kill innocent people or hijack planes is a moral crime.

'Flower' is that kind of movie that had a lot of potential, but just couldn't get it together for anyone to really relate to, even though it tried to be realistic. The film was directed by Max Winkler who hasn't really done anything before this, and was written by three male writers, which is weird, because the main characters are female, which causes some strange dialogue for sure.\nThe story centers on a teenage girl named Erica (Zoey Deutch, the chick from 'Everybody Wants Some'), who is a fast talking, inappropriate young woman who loves to eat at the bowling alley, draw penises in her notebook, and give anyone blowjobs that crosses her path. She seems to love giving blowjobs, but she blackmails everyone she does it to for all the cash they have with the help of her two dumb friends who sneak up on her victims with their camera phones. Erica's mother (Kathryn Hahn) is trying to pick up the pieces of recent breakups and Erica's biological dad who is in jail for something \"awesome\", but she has new boyfriend now named Sherm who comes with a teenage son who is awkward to say the least.Erica has no intention of being nice to this new kid who has moved in, but she changes her tune when she walks in on him trying to commit a ridiculous suicide attempt. From here, she learns that her future step brother has problems due to a former teacher who has molested him, which is the same person (Adam Scott), she has the hots for at the bowling alley. She tries to conceive a plan to blackmail this guy who has a different story of things. This is where the film turns into a ridiculous 'Very Bad Things' situation for no real reason at all and it just gets more disgusting from there. The problem here is that the writers and director failed to make Erica and her friends likable or redeeming in any way, shape or form.Right form the get-go, you hate this girl and her friends. You'd think if this was a coming-of-age film, there would be some sort of redeeming quality or someone would learn a thing or two, but not here. Everyone is just so annoying, unfunny, and just awful people, with the exception of Sherm and Erica's mother. With this aspect, you can't expect to love or connect with the main protagonist at all. Even if this movie was in the remote bit realistic (it definitely isn't), it still would seem far-fetched and unlikable.As for the performances themselves, I really like Zoey Deutch and she plays this part very well, but the character just gets in the way of being any sort of charming or witty. Adam Scott is fantastic in a role that's very subtly off in a bad way and he kills it in every frame. Hahn again is excellent too as the frazzled mother. 'Flower' should have been a great film, but due to the super unlikable characters and the film taking an over-the-top turn, there's just no redeeming part about it.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Despite being early in her career, actress Zoey Deutch has often been the highlight of her film projects. Although that sounds like a good thing, in her case it speaks not just to her talent, but also the quality of those choices. Her father is director Howard Deutch and her mother is Lea Thompson, so her industry bloodlines run deep. Her eyes and smile are truly luminescent on the big screen, where she comes across as a natural. It's now time for her take control of her career. Muck like this latest make us question whether she is a next level talent.Director Max Winkler (son of Henry \"The Fonz\" Winkler) co-wrote the script with Matt Spicer (a terrific INGRID GOES WEST) and Alex McAuley, and they are fortunate to have such talent as Ms. Deutch, Kathryn Hahn and Adam Scott. A profane, voyeuristic exercise in disturbed behavior becomes something nearly watchable when these three and newcomer Joey Morgan are on screen. Ms. Deutch plays Erica, a motor-mouthed (in more ways than one) force of nature teenager whose 'BJ's for Dad's bail' involves seducing older men and then extorting money from them after Erica's posse catches them on camera. Oh, and she keeps a sketch book of her victims ... no, not their faces. The fundraising approach to springing her dad from jail is difficult to accept, but Deutch sells it as best she can. Her mother (Kathryn Hahn) is desperately trying to build a relationship with Bob (Tim Heidecker), whose son Luke (Joey Morgan) is being released after a lengthy rehab stint for pills. Luke is a hefty young man who finds solace in food and little else. He and Erica could keep multiple therapists busy for years. His problems are exacerbated by an improper school incident involving Will Gordon, a teacher played by Adam Scott. Coincidentally, this same teacher has been labeled \"Old Hot Guy\" by Erica and her friends at the bowling alley. Once she learns about Luke's history with the pedophile, Erica plots an evil revenge. You can probably imagine where it goes from there.Those same eyes and smile mentioned in my first paragraph even light up when Erica describes herself as \"the d*** whisperer\". It's this kind of moment that finds us hoping Ms. Deutch and her agent quickly learn to distinguish between edgy indie project and trashy script not likely to lead to more work. This is an uncomfortable movie to watch, but not in the way where we walk out feeling enlightened.

Went in not knowing anything at all, which is actually a good thing. I'd like to do that more often just to have a clean slate and no expectations. I've got to say Zoey Deutch has never impressed me in any role. Either through the film sucking or her just not being spectacular she never shined. Finally, I can rate her in a role. Its not much different or completely out of left field for her but its a fine tuned performance. While the film is not perfect, and is let down at some moments its a good film.The film is about a carefree high school girl who meets her future step brother. Her step brother comes out of rehab and seems to have a dark-ish past. A few events lead to the reveal that her future step brother had previously been molested by an older teacher. Thus begins the mission of Erica (Deutch) to coax the man and also get revenge on him for the past wrongdoings that he has committed. The film also stars Kathryn Hahn and Adam Scott.As mentioned earlier Deutch is good in this. She is an at times grating character, so basically a typically teenager. Her performance is somewhat mesmerizing and has a bit of tragic happiness to it. The film is shot quit nicely and also seems to tackle a lot of issues that are tackled in teenage films often (orientation, sexuality, innocence, growing up love etc.). While I never found the film to be overly funny, I found it very entertaining until the last ten minutes.I think there was a good chance to go for a remarkable finish to a very solid film that was really flubbed up by the mess of a reveal and end. It doesn't take too much away from an interesting product, but yes it could have been better. I still had fun with it. Its obscene but at the same time obscenely entertaining.

It's quite clearly a film adaptation of a stage play, but it's a surprise (to me at least) that the stage play - penned by R.C. Sherriff - dates back to 1928 and was first performed in London by a young Laurence Olivier.You might say \"A filmed stage play? Hm... I'm not sure about that\". But actually, it works really well, adding brilliantly to the claustrophobic nature of the piece but - more importantly - largely eschewing \"action scenes\" to focus in on the dramatic relationships between the officers in their dugout and the men in the trenches above.The plot is a simple one. Set in the spring of 1918 (arguably, the movie might have been even more powerful had its release been delayed by about 6 weeks), Captain Stanhope (Sam Claflin, \"Me Before You\", \"Their Finest\") leads a company of men marching into position in a trench near Saint-Quentin, Aisne for a six-day tour of duty. Given they are one of 1,800 such companies on the Western Front, it's unfortunately their bad luck that the German's \"spring offensive\" is forecast to happen imminently. As Stanhope's CO (the excellent Robert Glennister, \"Live by Night\", TV's \"Hustle\") makes clear, and as the film's title might also suggest, this is forecast to be a one-way trip.With immaculate timing, squeaky-keen young recruit Lieutenant Raleigh (Asa Butterfield, \"Hugo\") uses his brass-connections to join the company, since he knows Stanhope from his schooldays. Indeed, Stanhope is his sister's beau. But Raleigh soon discovers that Stanhope is no longer the 'affable chap' he was.... Butterfield is marvelously cast as the perky new recruit, all wide-eyed and eager on arrival but completely ill-equipped for what he is to see and experience in a confined society being stretched beyond breaking point. Claflin as well is superb, and must have spent hours in front of a mirror trying to perfect his haunted expression. The range of emotions he delivers through those eyes is just extraordinary. Finally rounding out the star-turns of the officers are Paul Bettany (\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\") as the avuncular Osborne and Tom Sturridge (\"Far From The Madding Crowd\") as the shell-shocked and useless Hibbert.Those of you familiar with the splendid \"Black Adder Goes Forth\" will know the comic role played by Tony Robinson as Baldrick with his strange culinary concoctions. In this film Toby Jones (\"Atomic Blonde\", \"Dad's Army\") fills that role and similarly has some comic lines to add - just a touch of - much needed light-relief to the tension.The film has a necessarily melancholic feel, but (for me) it's rather over-egged by the sonorous cello score by Natalie Holt and Hildur Gudnad\u00f3ttir. (Again, reflecting our different tastes, I'll point out that my wife found the music fitting and not as annoying and intrusive as I did). Director Sean Dibb (Suite Fran\u00e7aise) has here delivered a tense and very well-executed movie that ably demonstrates the British \"stiff upper lip\" in public - and the weak whiskey-soaked psychosis in private - of men under the most unbearable stress imaginable. Recommended... but go expecting something that's more drama than World War One 'action'.(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

{"imdbId": "tt3780500", "movieTitle": "Journey's End", "title": "A courageous journey", "author": "TheLittleSongbird", "postedDate": "8 February 2018", "reviewContent": "Have always loved RC Sherriff's play 'Journey's End' ever since studying it twice in secondary school in English when studying World War I literature. 'Journey's End' is fascinating and powerful enough when reading it, it is even more so when talking about and analysing it when all the different perspectives, themes, conflicts and distinctions are picked up on.This 2017 film adaptation lived up to my already high expectations and more. To me, it's one of 2017's (released this year here) best and most emotional films but sadly it is likely to go under-appreciated, due to being released very close to the Oscars/Academy Awards ceremony, not yet having a worldwide release (so far only restricted to three countries) and being alongside films that by type audiences are more likely to go and see. That's my feeling at the moment and here's to hoping in the future it will be proved wrong, because it does deserve much better than that. Not just because it is a wonderful film but also that as said giving a film that does an important subject justice and so far get a limited release in a centenary year is something of a disrespect.'Journey's End' is very successful at capturing the spirit of Sherriff's play in themes and characterisation, with all the different varied perspectives, varied class distinctions and characters that easily could have been just world war clich\u00e9s rightly given the complexity they have in the play. It is equally successful in not being stage bound or too stagy, a danger with play to film adaptations and a trap fallen into numerous times, capturing the tense claustrophobia of the setting while opening out the action that it feels cinematic without getting overblown.There is a real sense of innocence, courageousness, conflict and tragedy, with the powers of loyalty and friendship being rays of hope in a hopeless situation. 'Journey's End' is an emotionally complex play and needs an emotionally complex film with all those themes present, something that we get here. This is not a film to be dismissed for having a familiar message, considering the different perspectives and varied characterisations (shell-shocked and conflicted captain, loyal and voice of reason \"uncle\" figure, the somewhat na\u00efve youth, the coward, the comic relief) there is so much more to 'Journey's End' than just saying that \"war is hell\", far too simplistic a description for what it's trying to say. On an emotional level, 'Journey's End' is tremendously powerful, making its points without being heavy-handed, being incredibly heartfelt that you really care for the characters' fates and find it very difficult to hold back tears and making one really appreciate the bravery of those who fought and not to forget them or take them for granted.Visually, 'Journey's End' is very well made. Evocative and handsome in design, bleakly atmospheric in how things are lit and colour scheme and there is a suitably claustrophobic dynamic to the camera work that opens up the action and captures the full horrors of this period. The music is suitably urgent and melancholic, didn't find it that intrusive personally.Dialogue wrenches the gut, breaks the heart and provokes thought, and brings out every ounce of what makes the characters more than just world war clich\u00e9s. Can't fault the continually compelling and powerful storytelling or the direction. 'Journey's End' is very strongly acted, especially Sam Claflin in an intensely brooding and heartfelt performance as Stanhope, a very conflicted character with plenty of meat to him and a representation of how those were damaged by war and seen what it is like. Paul Bettany plays Osborne with plenty of sympathetic authority, being the figure all live up to and holds everything together. Asa Butterfield captures Raleigh's youthful naivety, with his point of view of war initially being a less realistic one, but that was true of a lot of men who fought in the war being proud to fight for their country without knowing what they were in for.Toby Jones provides some welcome comic relief as Mason without jarring, and Stephen Graham similarly as Trotter. Robert Glenister is a commanding colonel and Tom Sturridge is a convincing cowardly figure.Overall, a brilliantly done and powerful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt6303872", "movieTitle": "Maineland", "title": "Globalization High", "author": "pyrocitor", "postedDate": "21 October 2017", "reviewContent": "Early on in Maineland, after a series of entrance interviews vetting potential high school students from Mainland China for candidacy for an international exchange to prestigious American boarding school Freyburg academy, the admissions director chortles at the camera, \"I think they're just telling us what we'd like to hear.\" It's a beautifully subversive moment. On one hand, it microcosmically unearths the potential dissonance between cross-cultural values (the rampant individuality revered by the States vs. the pressure towards order and homogeneity in China) the rest of the film will continue to gently knead the wrinkles out of. It's a sneaky p*ss-take on a fundamentally inauthentic interview process, showing that, no matter what country they come from, most teenagers are fundamentally the same at heart. And, it's also a deceptive moment of self-reflexivity (after all, what is a documentary if not subjects, with varying gradients of authenticity, telling audiences what they think they'd like to hear?) that director Miao Wang subtly plants the seed for, then, playfully, proceeds to never again address. On the surface, Maineland is a fly-on-the-wall account of a group of these Chinese high schoolers spending a significant chunk of their teen years acquainting themselves with life in the U.S. at Freyburg. But it's also one of the more understated but insistent cinematic parables of globalization of the past several years, poking at roots of internationally symbiotic culture and commerce that will only continue to grow in tandem with the film's burgeoning protagonists. Wang's directorial hand is as quietly tongue-in-cheek as it is unostentatious, her film a series of vignettes offering the briefest peeks into the lives of the students. Through a scattering of interviews and mirthful documentary eavesdropping, and focalized through two suitably contrasting leads - extroverted, giggly social butterfly Stella, and more withdrawn, philosophical Harry - Wang offers up snapshots of the student experience. In the 90 minutes we spend in their presence, we get fleeting, deliberate peeks into their social circles (integrating with the locals, and, largely, finding solace in hanging with the other Chinese students), their schoolwork, their personal existential struggles, and - perhaps most important - what to wear? Seamless and beautifully shot as Maineland is, there's also an unshakable sense of Wang determining her own guiding focus throughout the course of making the film (at the Q&A following the film's Canadian premiere, she shared an amusing anecdote of having a prospective third 'lead character,' only to realize the girl in question was profoundly antisocial, and only ever wanted to sleep - a somewhat less compelling talking head). As such, several glimmers of subplots are flirted with then abandoned (one, detailing several of the Chinese students in a film class making their own meta-documentary on how their presence affects the Freyburg community is too fascinating for its omission here not to be a tragedy). These ably sketch out a more expansive experience for the students beyond the parameters of the camera lens, but also, consequently, make the film's pacing somewhat wobbly throughout. The film's premise leaves countless avenues of theme and social commentary ripe for the picking, but, for the most part, Wang remains coyly mum on larger conversations you can tell she's just itching to play up. Instead, she lets the tiniest moments of poignancy speak volumes without crass accentuation - for class commentary (inescapable in the burgeoning economy of international tuition), the briefest teasing sequence of Stella agonizing over which of her several pairs of Jimmy Choos to wear to prom. For their part, the teens themselves are impressively candid and lucid with their intentions for the exchange (dodging rigorous Chinese post-secondary exams; advancing future career prospects; their parents wanting them to) - though, again, maybe they're just telling us what we want to hear. Conversely, many of the film's more revealing - and comedic - moments have several well-intentioned New Englander teachers tripping over their words trying to wax poetic about the influx of specifically Chinese international students, paradoxically exposing themselves as somewhat less worldly than they'd like to present. The Freyburg admissions directors are more forthright: international tuition is what keeps their academy alive, and Chinese students alone comprise nearly half of that audience. It's simply too big a market not to tap into, even while postulating that both Chinese and American socioeconomic and cultural infrastructures will continue to change in interesting, imperceptible, and unpredictable ways as a result of the cultural cross-pollination. It's a sly, sobering breath of fresh air in a Western cultural landscape increasingly fraught with suspicion and hostility towards immigrants (another social commentary Wang, somewhat problematically, sidesteps). Instead, Wang's film, rather than aggressively taking the topical bull by the horns, opts for a fundamentally friendlier, timeless take on a timely issue. Maineland is an unassuming treat - a gentle, wryly tongue-in-cheek meditation on adolescence, diasporic cultural identity, and the conflation of education and economy. It's one of the more subtly astute conversations on globalization packaged in a thoroughly pleasant, if not overtly groundbreaking, 90 minutes. And that is telling us exactly what we want to hear. -8/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The director does an intrepid job following the young high school students lives from urban China to the contrast of rural Maine.

It does too little to clearly explore the sociological impact of both the young people and how they impacted those around them. They didn't really focus on the racism they experienced or the impact on their peers. There was too much of just cinema verite presentation without really clearly steering the narrative clearly enough.

The poor writing lets boredom seep into the movie through planet-sized plot holes that quite admirably manage to furrow in disbelieving thought even the dumbest kid's brow.\nA lacklustre CGI, along with a annoying cinematography, a truly forgettable soundtrack and a horrific screenplay contribute to create a completely obscene movie, which is so boring that watching the grass grow for the rest of your life would seem a far more palatable activity than give this movie a second chance.Pacific Rim : Uprising is a collage of dull scenes quite badly glued together, a movie which is tragically deprived of whatsoever emotional impact. A twelve hour straight Pac-man gameplay can create more hype and has a far stronger emotional impact than this movie.A total disappointment.CGIPacific Rim's CGI was truly something. It admirably managed to convey the power, the bulkiness and the mechanical presence of the robots, the raw power of every hit, the slightest nuances of any movement made by a giant robot that was driven by humans. It was a rare jewel.\nIn Uprising the CGI is disappointing. Lacklustre, cheap and badly melded with the rest of the scene. There are no more three-dimensional, giant robots made of moving, bruised iron plates, or solid, bulky steel giant mechas with a weight, or some realistic, a bit sluggish movements.They look like toys, their parts, gears and plates plain and stiff, barely moving. Robots are light, unrealistically quick and agile models. \nThe design of the robots is pretty lazy and uninspired, and really reminds me of some cheap plastic robot action figures.\nTheir textures are also quite cheap.\nThis gets a little better with the Kaijus, they are honestly cool.CinematographyThe dark, ominous tones of the first movie completely disappear. While this is not an intrinsically bad thing, it contributes to create a blindingly white, overall fake, aseptic scenery, that while it's understandable given the setting of this movie, in my opinion is irritating.\nThe already excessive holographic colour fest of the Jaegers' HUDs of the first movie is unnecessarily amplified here, it almost gave me an headache. \nTruly bothersome.Storytelling.\nHere we go.\nThe lack of chemistry between the characters, due to a criminally low level of writing, is the true common thread of the movie. The characters are dull, their backstories already heard in every action movie released so far.\nTheir development in the movie is either non-existent or plainly wrong.\nThe human reactions are somewhat odd, not quite believable.\nFunnily enough, some of the lines unwillingly probe the screenplay and expose it's flaws, but it's a bitter laugh.\nThe whole screenplay features horrible, cheesy lines that would have seemed ridiculous even in an '80s action movie featuring Steven Seagal. \nThe screenplay is truly awful and predictable , every subplot is either forgotten or comes to conclusion in no more than 20 minutes. \nThere is a good thing in this screenplay, there's a thing I'd never expected and that truly caught me off guard, but it's not enough. I'm fairly sure I didn't see that coming cause I got distracted when the usher reprimanded a kid who'd put his feet on the seat in front of him.\nAn inch higher than Independence Day 2, but well, it's not really a compliment.Cringe soars to unrivalled heights with a reference to the salt bae.\nGood thing : Cailee Spaeny's acting is really good.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

If you look at Wes' filmography, you will notice that each of his films progressively become more focused, detailed, and \"Wes Anderson-ey\". It feels as if his films have been building to a culmination of sorts, which can be represented with Isle of Dogs.The story revolves around a young boy, Atari, who is seeking his lost dog with help from a pack of dogs on Trash Island, right outside of Megasaki City (word-play on Nagasaki), a fictional future city of Japan that is exiling dogs due to a \"canine flu\" outbreak.From a filmmaking viewpoint, Isle of Dogs has it all in spades, and more. The characters are well rounded and relatable, even though the majority of them are dogs. The presentation of the story is very fresh and unique, and the humor is always smoothly intertwined with the narrative and visuals. With a runtime of an hour and 40 minutes, it flies by, always keeping your attention and further engaging you. The stop-motion animation is very well done, and the way it is contrasted with beautiful Japanese imagery is stunning. The soundtrack is also excellent, and aids in telling the story. There are many nods towards Japanese cinema, chiefly Akira Kurosawa's films, which you can tell that Wes has a passion for. The voice cast is star-studded and wonderful as always. There are plenty of twists and surprises, and the film leaves the viewers with some important messages/themes to ponder over. It is best to go into the movie knowing as little about the story as possible, and let it take you on its journey.This film will greatly reward repeat viewings. The attention to detail in every frame is incredible, and there is always so much on the screen to absorb and process, in the best way possible. I believe that Wes Anderson has the most distinct and easily discernible style of any filmmaker to ever live, and this quality alone is something to be praised very highly.If you love dogs, Japanese cinema/culture, stop-motion, and animation in general, then you will love this film all the more so. Isle of Dogs, shows Wes at his full unfiltered creative power, stretching his capabilities, and giving us something truly remarkable.Ineffable Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls052767730/", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I wasn't sure how he would do with a non-Western setting but he managed well.He keeps his unique style and it works very well with the futuristic, but still traditional Japanese art. It also incorporates some cartooning along with interesting ideas - the Japanese dialogue is not always translated and when it is, it's by interpreters or foreign exchange students. Anderson manages to merge his style with the Japanese and it works seamlessly.It's a very quirky film with an all too relatable story. I enjoyed the visuals more than the plot, I'll admit, but it was still a good movie, with the usual quick dialogues, jokes, strange characters - Tilda Swinton being the weirdest, no surprise there - and altogether it's a great experience.Without spoilers, if you like Wes Anderson, you will like this movie. If you don't, buckle up, because this is jam-packed with everything that is his style, the quirky music works now fused with Japanese, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and the usual cast having very well fitting characters (watch out for the credits Anjelica Huston is there as a Mute Poodle) and the cinematography being interesting and stunning.P.S.

{"imdbId": "tt5104604", "movieTitle": "Isle of Dogs", "title": "How could you NOT love it?", "author": "Brian Sciro", "postedDate": "28 March 2018", "reviewContent": "In my experience, Wes Anderson films have always made great date films.Not even joking. My first proper movie date was with my girlfriend was when we saw The Grand Budapest Hotel. We instantly fell in love with it, and it's a night I still remember fondly for the experience we had in a theater that consisted mainly of us and one other couple. It was simply magical.And that, perhaps, is what makes me love Wes Anderson's work so much; it's simply movie magic. The man can take any setup he pleases and turn it into a whimsical, silly, but somehow all the same \"Important\" piece of film that holds its own weight. In short, Wes Anderson has made himself an icon when it comes to the quirky and whimsy in film. His films are a warm blanket that I love to wrap myself in.In 'Isle of Dogs', the immediate strengths of Wes Anderson are apparent: the worlds he builds. The world of Megasaki and Trash Island are all realized in vivid detail, complete with a massive array of characters on both human and animal ends that one can recall and adore. Rather than the recent disappointment of 'Black Panther', where characterization took a backseat, this film OOZES character and a rich world you can feel. You can show me images of characters from this film and from their appearance ALONE I can tell you a story about them and what I enjoyed about them. The colorful and vast array of characters is something I think I loved most about this film, and still sticks with me even as I write this review.What else has to be admired regarding this film is its respectful and quite incredible treatment of Japanese culture and art. Right from the get-go, Anderson makes it apparent he WANTS the culture to envelope us. All Japanese characters speak Japanese. Only 1-2 humans speak English. The dogs only speak \"English\" for the benefit of our understanding of their dialogue. Megasaki LOOKS like Japan. Japanese text is constantly displayed and is translated in subtitles for only our benefit. There is clear respect paid to the culture Wes wishes to show us, and for having that courage to not simplify it out of sheer convenience, I admire his work here.Additionally, the homages to Japanese cinema, specifically Kurosawa, were welcome beyond all belief in this film. This film is hardly a zany and swift-moving animated film that one sees in this day and age. Heck, it is not even in the same league of movement and speed as Fantastic Mr. Fox was. Rather, this is a film that runs on its own pace, derived from Japanese cinema, and finds its footing in that delivery. It is a crisp, complete-feeling film that FEELS like a 2-hour film, but in the end, it barely coasts over 100 minute total...but it feels absolutely perfect in the time we are given in this rich world. In fact, by the time the film ended, I wanted MORE of the world I had seen.The animation, as if you are even remotely surprised, is GORGEOUS. Every frame, and I mean EVERY FRAME, is just magnificent to look at. Where Fantastic Mr. Fox had the warm cinematography on its side, Isle of Dogs sports a bleaker texture, though it manages to create its own charm that way. You feel the characters' emotions through their well-animated faces, you can see every hair on the dogs' bodies move, you feel every movement of this film and adore it for how charming and Wes Anderson-y it is. Thankfully, the only thing you can NOT feel is the scent of Trash Island...The only thing that has bugged me since seeing this film, however, is how little time the film has to really have FUN. The film is surprisingly played straight in most regards when it comes to conflict, and its tone is whimsy in some regards, but the laughs are surprisingly not as common as you would suspect them to be in a Wes Anderson product. This is not a case of a cultural barrier, but perhaps simply that the story Anderson chose to tell was far more important than including all the laughs he could. The tone of this film is \"different\" than most of his films, which is perhaps a good thing. It works for the film...but for most, I imagine \"different Wes Anderson\" won't click with everyone.The lack of too much \"fun\" is noticeable, however, in that we do not see too much of the silly side of this world Wes Anderson has built. We get occasional glimpses and gags that are classic Anderson and certainly hit, but by the end, it is a surprisingly serious tone the film chooses to maintain in its climax. Again, this WORKS, but I wonder how much more I would have loved the film if it were as child-like and fun as Fantastic Mr. Fox or Grand Budapest Hotel tended to be.The sometimes-noticeable lack of \"fun\", however, does not detract entirely from the enjoyment of the film itself. It is just as quirky and out-there in the best ways possible as any other Wes Anderson film, and thanks to that, the film simply beams with charm. Whether it be its animation style, Anderson's unique direction, or the fantastically unique score by Alexandre Desplate, this film sticks-out as any good Wes Anderson film should.That said, the strongest thing (Aside from the animation) about this film is its subtle message it attempts to strike. This film is one about companionship and love, which is a feeling that often goes hand-in-paw with the subject of dogs and pets. If you have ever been a dog owner, this film WILL strike a chord with you, as it has some very important things to say about our relationship with them that I think often goes understated.Dogs are a connection. Dogs are a beacon of loyalty and family. \"Dogs\" don't need to be dogs. Dogs are man's best friend.How could you not love dogs?How could you not love a Wes Anderson film ABOUT dogs?", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Unsane is like that. The title indicates that the main character might be insane but also might not be insane.  Well, it turns out the this movie has an excellent title because that's pretty accurate summation of the movie. A bit longer summation goes like this: the main character might be insane but also might not be insane but some people think she is insane but she makes some erratic choices so she cannot convince everyone that she's not insane but maybe she does that because she actually is insane.  Sawyer Valentini (a strikingly unhinged Claire Foy) seems normal enough at first glance. She works a steady financial analyst job at a bank. She has a loving relationship with her mother. She goes on Tinder dates. But she's troubled by someone from her past, a man who has been stalking her for the past two years. She has difficulty dealing with the stress, so she turns to medication and therapy to cope.  In her conversation with a therapist, she casually mentions that she's had suicidal thoughts in the past. The therapist exploits this casual mention and tricks Sawyer into signing a waiver voluntarily committing herself to 24 hours of observation at the clinic.  Once inside, things become increasingly frustrating for Sawyer and even more so for viewers. She lashes out violently multiple times and ignores the advice of one helpful patient recovering from an opioid addiction, Nate, (Jay Pharoah showing off impressive dramatic acting chops), which subsequently gives the staff reason to extend her stay an additional week. Her inability to control her temper makes viewers wonder if she really does belong there.That's as much as I can reveal without introducing spoilers. I can say that movie is a bit of a slow burn early on. Then the action picks up in a big way. The story veers in a different direction, which causes some problems because we miss backstory that would have tied the story together in a neater, more affecting way. As it stands, the movie has a lot going on, but no part feels fully developed. Foy's lead performance and Soderberg's filmmaking keeps the film watchable throughout, but ultimately, it all feels a little unsatisfying.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It was being talked about by everyone at the Berlinale film festival as 'the iPhone film', but as this was Steven Soderbergh - needless to say I was incredibly intrigued and knew there must be more to it than the fact it was shot on an iPhone. The press conference was fascinating. In short the benefits of shooting on an iPhone greatly outweighed the few cons according to Soderbergh. He used the iPhone app FiLMiC Pro to shoot Unsane, as this allowed him complete manual control over the shot on par with high end cinema cameras (manual focus, exposure, white balance, LOG etc). For hard to reach shots where he couldn't see the screen - he used an app called FiLMiC Remote to wirelessly control his iPhone from another device on set. He described the process as liberating and wished he had access to this technology when he was starting out at age 15. He described the space between creative impulse and technical execution as being almost non-existent thanks to the iPhone.The actors commented on how much they loved moving so quickly and not having the 'filmmaking machine' slow things down on set, allowing them to remain in character and creative.Well now for the actual film... in short it was INCREDIBLE. After the first 2 minutes you completely forget it was shot on an iPhone. If you went into the theatre unaware of the fact it was shot on a smartphone you wouldn't even know. People need to stop calling this 'the iPhone film'. It is a great film that looks beautiful (in a dark and grungy way perfect for the story) that happens to be shot on an iPhone. Exciting times for new filmmakers just starting out for sure.Claire Foy is just incredible and gives a raw performance that doesn't let up. I was never a huge fan of hers before - but am now (going to give The Crown another go).There is a real sense of panic and claustrophobia thanks to the use of wide lenses and close proximity to the actors that probably is in large part due to the fact it was shot on a smartphone. You really feel like you are thrust into the very middle of this nightmare - so kudos to Soderbergh for that.I've seen some reviews that called Unsane 'silly' - but I think some critics want it to be something it isn't. This is genre filmmaking at its very best - and blast to watch and a reminder that Soderbergh is a master of his trade and can effortlessly move between genres.Go watch it with a group of friends. Don't let the fact that it was shot on iPhone put you off - you won't notice once you're sucked in, and you'll be inspired to know you can create a filmic masterpiece with what is in your pocket. This is one of my favourite Soderbergh films - and my fav of the Berlinale.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt7153766", "movieTitle": "Unsane", "title": "As a psychiatrist and a film lover, I was highly disappointed.", "author": "Charles Camp", "postedDate": "1 April 2018", "reviewContent": "As someone who works in the mental health field, the first act of this movie excited me. The set up seemed to suggest a film that would attempt to capture the experience of a psychotic individual who finds herself involuntarily committed; to convey the confusion and desperation of such an experience for the patient, and perhaps the callousness of the staff who have become so jaded to such a presentation that they fail to meet the emotional needs of that patient. I felt genuinely uncomfortable through the first 20-30 minutes of the film as this scenario was explored, so much so that it forced me to reflect on my own experiences with psychotic patients and how important it is not to lose that level of empathy regardless of how routine the work may become. Furthermore, I was tantalized by the possibilities of the film in blurring the line between delusion and reality, expecting it to keep me questioning what was real and what wasn't.And then the film throws all of that into a wood chipper. And burns the wood chips. Unfortunately, from here I'm really going to have to get into specifics, ie spoilers, so,***SPOILERS***First, I just have to mention the numerous inaccuracies here in the depiction of an inpatient psychiatric ward. The physical setup of the facility is quite odd with its communal bedroom shared by all of the patients which is locked every night without any staff member being physically present inside. Even more unlikely is that during the day the patients are allowed to wander around the rest of the facility without seemingly any security. I'll concede that I obviously haven't seen every possible inpatient setting design, but this is quite removed from anything I'm familiar with.More problematic though are the way restraints and seclusions are portrayed in the film. Restraints and forced medication can happen if an agitated patient is unable to be calmed by any other measure and is at imminent risk of harm to themselves or others, but patients are never restrained in a communal room and then left alone for extended periods of time, unmonitored by staff, and no less surrounded by other inpatients who are often psychotic and potentially dangerous. Medication injections are also always given in a muscle rather than in a vein as depicted here, and certainly never in a neck vein. Patients placed in a seclusion room are highly monitored and there are extremely strict regulations on how long a seclusion can last. It can not be used punitively and for indefinite periods of time as portrayed here. Opiate addiction on its own is never an indication for an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization and would never be covered by insurance. Staff members would never be able to secretly move patients to remote areas in a facility and hold them hostage there - everything is video monitored and it is standard for every patient to be physically checked on by nursing staff every 15 minutes.I could keep going, but I won't. Afterall, this is a movie. Films often can take liberties with reality, though for a film like this that is examining the mental health system and offering commentary on it, the gross inaccuracies are more problematic. Still, I did my best to see these as artistic liberties taken in the service of telling a story, entertaining an audience, and conveying a message. The problem is that the film fails on all of these levels as well.I mentioned earlier that I was tantalized at the possibilities that the film set up in blurring the line between delusion and reality, and I was completely let down. There is absolutely no ambiguity here, no intrigue, no possible interpretation where the stalker isn't real. And while that's far less interesting to me, it at least could've worked as an entertaining B-movie. But the plot is so offensively absurd that it crumbles even with the most cursory critical analysis. How did this stalker manage to get a job as a nurse at this facility within 24 hours of our protagonist showing up there? Did he kill the real nurse and pose as him? No - because then the nursing staff obviously would recognize him as an imposter in that case. Furthermore, a co-worker specifically comments that he is one of the most dependable nurses they have which obviously indicates he has some history at the job. So then is it a coincidence that our protagonist chose this facility from her random google search and her stalker just happened to have taken a job there prior? Did I miss some explanation for this? Even if I did, it's just incredibly improbable to the point of pure contrivance.And then our stalker is able to kidnap patients, hold them hostage, torture and kill them, all within a secured and staffed facility where patients would be monitored continuously as I previously mentioned. I had to stifle laughter when he explains to the protagonist, whom he is now indefinitely holding hostage in a seclusion room on a seemingly deserted, unstaffed floor of the hospital (which in itself is ludicrous), that the other staff members just \"assumed\" that she had been discharged and her insurance coverage had expired. A patient cannot be discharged from a hospital like this without clearance and direct orders from a psychiatrist, who then prepares all of the necessary paperwork, prescriptions, referrals to outpatient providers etc. It is a multidisciplinary process that involves the psychiatrist, nurses, and social workers. It's utterly laughable that the film asks you to believe that a patient would just be \"assumed\" discharged from a facility like these when none of this process had taken place.***END OF SPOILERS***Again, I could keep going but I'd be beating a dead horse. Highly disappointed with this film, and sadly it will likely perpetuate so many of the negative stigmas surrounding psychiatric hospitals. It does have some striking visuals here and there, the lead performance is quite good, and I did enjoy the raw quality of the filmmaking, but this is nowhere near enough to make up for its issues. I couldn't even recommend it to someone who has no knowledge of the mental health world as it totally fails as campy B horror/thriller too with its absurd plot and utter failure to capitalize on the potential for intrigue/ambiguity in the setup.

The budget also barely pokes over $1 million total. By all accounts, this is as INDIE as a big name director can get.So you probably will start asking yourself: \"How does it look?\" To me...I think the film would have been LESS interesting if it was filmed in the typical method of high quality digital cameras. I know I always use the term \"nightmarish\" to describe claustrophobic cinematography in films, but this film looks like a NIGHTMARE. Fluorescent lighting and angles look warped and distorted, as if our characters are living in a German expressionist film, close ups look terrifying as we see every emotional detail of these characters in sketchy quality that only a phone camera could really capture in full. The whole film looks like a fever dream, and unlike 'Tangerine' (The first feature film to be filmed on an iPhone), this film truly has a \"reason\" to be filmed in this style. To me, the experiment Steve Soderbergh tested here WORKED. The cinematography is its own style, and when a film can define itself with that sort of technique, it has certainly succeeded.Going hand-in-hand with this great cinematography is the surprising performance by Claire Foy, who is admittingly quite good in her role of a person you have to decide if you think is crazy or not crazy. She does have a few slip-ups where you can hear her British accent come out...but other than that, she is a convincing central character and I bought every emotion coming out of her.So it probably sounds like I really enjoyed this film thus far, correct?The problem is, I enjoyed the first TWO-THIRDS of this film. After that, I think this film absolutely falls apart and loses everything I thought it had going for it.A certain sequence in the film that looks absolutely SPECTACULAR is really the last time I connected with the film before a certain plot detail and twist begins to make itself apparent. As it began to unfold, I thought \"There's no way they'd go with something THIS stock and basic...\"Unfortunately, they do, and by the time the film is running-down its last 15-20 minutes, my intrigue had been sapped and I was left simply to watch a film that was going through the motions. A crime that films can commit is being \"Bad\", for sure, but a worse crime a film can commit is being \"Boring\". The third act of this film is guilty of exactly that. It's stock and went exactly as I predicted it would, which truly hurts.And let us discuss THE ENDING, which I think may be one of the worst of the last few years, right alongside 'The Devil Inside', 'Skyline' or 'The Florida Project'. The ending is such a sloppy and slapdash piece of cinema that I really wonder WHY they even bothered to shoot it. It's boring, cliche, has yet to really make much sense to me since I saw it (I saw this film on Tuesday, by the way...), it looks TERRIBLE in comparison with the rest of the film, and leaves us on a freeze-frame shot that looked completely unplanned and clearly done as a way to say \"Yep! That's the end!\". While I could've seen something more developed working in a similar vein, this just felt awful and like a last-ditch effort to end the film in an 'unresolved' manner, which this film never had the course for after its third act. Simply awful.In the end, I left this film feeling extremely disappointed, really. I was enjoying the film quite a bit up until a certain point, where everything just seemed to fall into the pits of the cliched and been-there-done-that. Perhaps it was partly my fault for expecting more out of a film that promised a unique look and story about sanity, but in the end, I can blame the film as well for squandering such an incredible opportunity to make an interesting psychological thriller/horror film with such a weak third act. It PAINS ME that this film couldn't be good all the way through....THAT SAID...I really cannot say enough about the cinematography in this film. Steve Soderbergh's work in this (Yes, he directed AND filmed this!) looks absolutely stellar, even for an iPhone camera, and makes it worth seeing just for curiosity's sake alone. I feel it works far better than it did for 'Tangerine', and clicks with me on a level that it puts you in the perspective of our protagonist, who is struggling with her sanity in a place that is a proverbial nightmare. The film looks like a bad dream, and in the end, that appealed to me on that level of loving to see experimenting in film.It's just a shame that the intriguing experimentation meant a sacrifice for an intriguing story and third act. This could have been a far better film than it was. In the end, it lands somewhere in the middle for me...though I REALLY wish it didn't...", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I tell you honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and frankly at the end I was surprised by how much I had enjoyed it. It is far funnier, and far more creative, than its throw-away pun of a title would suggest.True, the story, which takes often broad comedic swipes at a well-established literary franchise, dares to ask its audience to accept the dual conceits that not only do we humans share our world with clay/ceramic garden gnomes which are actually living sentient creatures, but also that one of them is a hyper-intelligent investigator with a strong sense of duty. But once the story gets going (lead into by a Looney Tunes-esque news report), it does prove to have a surprisingly complex plot, in which there is in fact is a mystery in need of solving.Performances of minor and supporting characters range from acceptable to very good. The leads are very well done. Depp's Sherlock is arrogant and socially awkward yet comically unaware of this; he's also dry almost to the point of being the \"straight man\". Ejiofor readily elicits sympathy for his exasperated and put-upon Watson. McAvoy's Gnomeo and Blunt's Juliet are played with a good range of emotions, although in my opinion McAvoy goes further, for comedy/action effect.With so many full-CGI movies today, especially those ostensibly meant for children, it's easy for the viewer to get jaded and miss the details. This is unfortunate, because often the filmmakers put great detail into their films which enrich the viewing, even if those details are only seen subconsciously. \"Sherlock Gnomes\" is just such a movie, with often stunningly-rendered CGI. In an \"over the shoulder\" shot of Sherlock talking with Juliet, the side of his pointy, aquiline nose can be seen; it shows flecks and minor chips like an actual ceramic figure would have. This gives more visual weight to the scene than it would've had if that surface were rendered simply as a smooth plane. In another scene, we see that the apron strings tied around Juliet's back are not three-dimensional moving objects; they are in fact rendered to look hand-painted on, as they would be on an actual garden figure. A city scene of people walking past shops is so well-rendered, for a moment I actually thought I was seeing footage rather than animation. Along with the quality of the CGI, this film also has highly creative visuals. Sherlock's \"mind palace\" sequences are beautifully rendered as line-art animations.It is this rich detail which makes the film's one down point stand out so poorly. While the movie's soundtrack features much music by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, this is not a musical. For me, the inclusion of what was in essence a music video in the middle of the story was very jarring. The song is performed by a doll voiced by Mary J. Blige. Her character is well-rendered, and her dialogue is nicely delivered; however her singing style combined with the over-produced music made the lyrics almost entirely unintelligible. I found myself wandering off, which was regrettable because I realized I had been missing more great visuals. In the background are very impressive \"dance troupe\" animations which clearly have Ziegfeld/Berkeley/Esther Williams-esque choreography. These are easy to miss but definitely deserve to be noticed.Some weak gags in the trailer are not used in the film, to the film's improvement; one that does remain leads to a \"Hound of the Baskervilles\" reference which works well.Finally, the film's well-placed tribute to Ray Harryhausen is to be greatly appreciated.Overall, \"Sherlock Gnomes\" is a surprisingly well-executed and enjoyable comedy. Only that misplaced song keeps me from scoring it higher. This is a great movie for kids, and a creative treat for adults, especially parents. 9 out of 10.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

That contained no \"twerking\" or \"fart jokes\" like in the trailer (I think they were only animated for the trailer, not too sure why). The movie is smart and funny, it has good messages for kids and maybe even adults. Super action packed and also for any Sherlock fans, I spotted a couple sherlock related easter eggs.\nIt is not only exciting but very beautifully animated and the lighting is also stunning. I think that this take on Sherlock Holmes is a very different one but still stays true to Conan Doyle's story (the easter eggs are very clever). I believe it is a good way to introduce kids to those characters. It is also impressive since this movie came from Paramount which has little to no experience in the animation world. I have no idea how the creators of this movie were able to make \"Sherlock Gnomes\" into a really great animated movie, that is closer to a Disney or Pixar type movie then an illumination movie.Last thing, not too sure why its getting such terrible reviews (19% on rotten tomatoes) I would say at worst some parts of the movie are mediocre, but it still does not deserve 19%.

It has action, comedy, good music, and uplifting themes, making it an entertaining movie for kids and watchable enough for parents.\nTips for parents: Profanity like \"Cheese & Crackers!\" and \"Fertilizer!\"\nYou see quite a bit of a dancing gnome in a thong. If you saw the first Gnomeo & Juliet, you've already been introduced to Mankini, a character kids will laugh at, yet one who is pretty inappropriate for young children, in my opinion. The first Gnomeo & Juliet was rated G, but this one is PG for using some rude and suggestive humor. Mankini's appearances definitely bumped up the rating. \nThere is some potty humor that will make most parents squirm.\nSome subtitles\nAll British accents and landmarks in London.\nUplifting theme: \"We all have our good and bad sides.\" - Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor)\n\"A man doesn't make you strong, but the right partner can make you stronger.\" - Juliet (Emily Blunt)\n\"We took our best friends for granted. We stopped listening. We stopped giving them the respect they deserved.

Blige.\nThe animation is very well done with impressively expressive characters.\nLots of physical gags and entertaining visuals.\nFun soundtrack of popular hits and new songs.\nIt uses several different types of animation, which I thought was cleverly done.\nA couple of twists. I love twists.\nThe sound effects were really good, allowing you to hear the clay pots and hear the weight of the gnomes.\nStay to the end of the rolling credits to see a few more little things.\nKids will like the use of modern technology in the story telling.\nThings I didn't like:Sherlock Gnomes is pretty annoying and not very likable. If only they had gotten Benedict Cumberbatch to play the voice! He does a fantastic job in the TV adaptation. That would have been awesome and hilarious. Don't get me wrong, because Johnny Depp was fine, but Cumberbatch as Sherlock...come on!\nThere are a lot of jokes that kids simply won't get because they're references to older generations, like the River Dance gag.\nI started to get bored.

The music was also excellent, a gorgeous score that was paired with some nice cinematography and production design.

That message, the one that is basically Christ's Sermon on the Mount, is the crux of the film. This gives it an emotional heft that is quite poignant.

{"imdbId": "tt4799066", "movieTitle": "Midnight Sun", "title": "romantic, but uneven, predictable and emotionally manipulative", "author": "Dave McClain", "postedDate": "24 March 2018", "reviewContent": "\"Midnight Sun\" (PG-13, 1:31) is a romantic drama about a teenage girl who suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum, or XP, a rare genetic disorder which renders those afflicted prone to serious medical complications when exposed to sunlight. The film is directed by Scott Speer (helmer of the 2012 and 2014 \"Step Up\" movies) & written by Kenji Brando, based on the 2006 Japanese film of the same name. Often playing mean girls, actress and singer Bella Thorne this time gets to play a more sympathetic character, Katie Price, a 17-year-old with such a severe case of XP that even minimal exposure to the sun could be deadly. Consequently, she spends all of the daylight hours behind specially-tinted windows in her house with her single dad (Rob Riggle, shedding his usual comedic persona for another dramatic role). Besides her dad, Katie's only friend is a fellow teenager named Morgan (Quinn Shepherd) who one day knocked on the door to play with the mysterious girl who never came outside... and never stopped coming around. Katie stays upbeat and makes the most of her life, such as it is, but she does wish she had at least one more friend, a boy named Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger, establishing himself as more than just Arnold's son), whom Katie longingly watched pass by her house for the past 10 years.Having been homeschooled by her dad, Katie is treated to a private graduation ceremony (at home, of course) on the same day that her peers graduate and he lets her indulge in one of her favorite hobbies, playing her guitar and singing on the platform of her local Seattle-area train station. There she finds herself face-to-face with Charlie for the first time and she kind of freaks out. Charlie is charmed by her awkwardness (and attracted to her natural beauty), so he pursues her until she agrees to go on a date with him. Although she insists on only meeting him at night - and one date turns into several - she struggles with when and how to tell him about her condition... knowing he'll find out sooner or later.\"Midnight Sun\" is similar to 2017's \"Everything Everything\", but the latter was a little better. It's a miracle Katie wasn't morbidly obese by the second act, considering all the scenery chewing Thorne did early in this film. However, once Katie and Charlie become a couple, most of the rest of the story is fairly touching, although the plot points often feel contrived. Unfortunately, Thorne seems made up and dressed to look like fellow 20-something actress Zoey Deutch, who is more talented and more beautiful than Thorne. The latter plays vulnerable and sympathetic very well, but stumbles when she's trying to act awkward or comedic. Her great singing voice (an important part of her character) and her performance as a girl being romanced by her dream boyfriend mostly redeems her... if the initial overacting hasn't made you stop watching... and if you can get past the emotionally manipulative plot. \"C\"", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Must Watch.I went to the movie theater after going through multiple mixed reviews from the so-called movie critics. \nFor those who have seen the trailer, this will be nothing new\nPlot: The main protagonist Naina Mathur has Tourette's syndrome who desperately wants to be a teacher. Even after multiple rejections, her decision to take up teaching as a profession remains firm. Finally, she gets offered, a job @ St.Nautkers but her class of 14 is full of rebels. We get glimpses of her childhood, as to how irritating it must have been to have been misunderstood and made fun of. She even shares an estranged relationship with her father. So basically, how she deals with all these hichkis is the story all about.Its a very simple plot of underdog meets underdogs and how they excel, but to make such a predictable plot interesting and watchable is where lies the craft of cinema. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, casting all in all was top notch. From the word go the movie started connecting. Everything was expressed in a subtle way. Nothing was over the top. There were many tear-jerking moments in the movie. There was never a dull moment. Every single character was bang on.Coming to performance, the 14 slum students(especially Aatish) were so good at their respective roles. Niraj Kabi as the other teacher was top notch, his transition in body language and dialogue delivery towards the end spoke leaps and bounds about how seasoned an actor he was. Sachin and Supriya as Naina's parents were apt. For obvious reasons, the belongs to Rani Mukerji. Rani as Naina Mathur is brilliant. She has given an outstanding performance which will guide many upcoming actors.No words to express my thoughts about how good an actor she is.As a die-hard Rani fan, I was nervous. I was just happy seeing her after 4 long years on the silver screen. Had no big expectation from the movie. But oh boy was I taken aback. The movie was something else. It was class apart.It was just awesome. It had the right pinch of ingredients.The main thing about the movie is that there is nothing forced, The music is not loud to drive you emotionally. You are at your own free will. It doesn't try to influence you. \nThe teacher-student relationship has been portrayed so well. A student will be fortunate to have a Naina Mathur teach them. Everything was intact. You will start reminiscing. It for sure will be a nostalgic experience for many. For the 1st time in my life, I clapped once the movie got over. That was the impact it had on me.One piece of advice to all the people out here, please comment after watching a movie. Don't mislead people with your prejudice. This movie deserves to be a hit. Only then more of such will be made. All we get to see is stupid masala flicks crossing 100 crores with ease. But movies like Hichki in spite of having a very strong content end up doing an average business, one main reason, without doubt, it has a female protagonist. Come on guys times are changing. Appreciate movie's content. Every teacher/student/parent should watch the movie. Hoping for the movie to do good business.

But some scenes will help the audience determine the climax of the film escalating the predictability of the film.

Logic fails are ultimate such as not rusticating the ransacking students or the fact that there's only one teacher teaching everything at once. Performances were simply outstanding and Rani Mukerji kills it. Her portrayal of Naina Mathur suffering Tourette Syndrome will just knoc your socks off.

She's rejected despited being armed with multiple degrees as the deciding authorities fear that her disorder will stand in the way of her teaching. The feisty Mathur doesn't take it lying down as she gives them a crash course on Tourette Syndrome unflinchingly.After five years of rigorous hunting, she finally lands a job at a Catholic school whose naming founder St Notker had a speech impediment. The coincidence felt contrived, but more on that later. She's is hired to teach 9F, a classroom of underprivileged rebels-slash-failures in this posh school. The school and its snobbish teachers seem to have written them off as the children of slum dwellers who don't deserve a chance. Mathur is on call to school these incorrigible teenagers.\nIt's a delight to watch Mukerji play Mathur with a blend of consummate conviction, grace and gravitas. It's easy to feel affectionate towards her aspirations and her unconventional methods of teaching. She's the kind of teacher who imparts physics lessons by bribing her students with boiled eggs. It works, as you wish you had a teacher who had stepped out of the box like Mukerji's character.She also takes several blows for her students, who try their best to smoke her out of the school. From petty pranks to planning mini explosions in the class, the group of 14 have a crazy aptitude for bullying.\nThe first half is dominated by Mukerji winning the reluctant misfits - acted out nicely by young talents such as Harsh Vyas as the rebellious Atish - over with her grit. Since they are children from the slums, there are ghetto-style rap songs inserted to communicate their angst. It doesn't bode too well with the film and seems contrived.\nWhile the performances by Mukerji and her gang of students come out with flying colours on the acting front, the film isn't high on novelty. The twists and conflicts are painfully predictable.\nActor Neeraj Kaabi plays the token snob who seems to be unnecessarily antagonistic towards the students of 9F. His tendency to vilify them seems unnecessary and Mathur is always trying to prove him wrong.\nWhile the casting by Shanoo Sharma is spot on, the camaraderie and the bond that grows between the teacher and the students seems forced. Their kinship doesn't feel organic, which is one of the biggest let downs of Hichki. However, the easy friendship between Mathur and her sibling is touchingly real.\nWhile Hichki is intent on communicating life-affirming philosophies such as 'there are no bad students, but just bad teachers' and 'conquer your fear and fly free', there were moments in this drama which are laboriously didactic.\nThe climax, which includes cheating and a painful examination as one of its plot twists, is also unnecessarily dramatic.\nBut that's a minor hiccup - or should I say Hichki - in an otherwise engaging feel-good drama.

It's a bio-pic that looks into the idiosyncratic mind of renown Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti (Geoffrey Rush) in a story so lacking in forward narrative that many will be left wondering why they watched it at all.Based on real events, Final Portrait is an adaptation of a memoir by American writer James Lord (Armie Hammer) who is flattered when asked to pose for a portrait by Giacometti. Believing it may be a single session, it turns out to take almost three weeks of daily sittings. The artist lives amidst chaotic mess with a long-suffering wife who tolerates his obsession with a prostitute girlfriend. He hates banks; prefers to hide cash under his studio rubble; has few social filters; and is liked by all despite a tendency insult others. The portrait sessions are constantly interrupted by long walks, drinks at nearby bars, and frequent outbursts due to chronic perfectionism that ensures his works are never finished. He is unable to walk past his clay sculptures without making a change and some are so altered that they are reduced to stick figures. Lord's amused and bewildered fascination with the life of a creative genius keeps him cancelling his return flight to America just to see his final portrait.The nineteen-day timeframe feels like the same event repeated nineteen times (mercifully, with some time compressions). Along the way, we watch the deeply etched face of the cantankerous Giacometti as he grimaces in self-rebuke, lusts after his girlfriend, and gazes deeply into the gaze of James Lord to search not for the look but the inner soul of another human being. If you can forgive Geoffrey Rush's Aussie-Swiss accent, there is much to admire in his characterisation of an angst-ridden artist. But it is also wearingly repetitive. Lord is the master's foil as the suited slick- back straight guy. Initially adrift in the world of an erratic painter, he is conservative and upright yet his vanity is drawn like a moth to the flame of genius, eager to understand Giacometti's creativity. While both play their part brilliantly, it is Geoffrey Rush who dominates the screen. The studio set is cluttered and claustrophobic, like the artist's mind, and the cinematography employs the shallow depth-of-field effect to dwell on detail, allowing sharply focused faces to peer between blurred works of art as if to say these are but points in time that will never find their final form.There are clever ironies in watching a painter who studies his subject, while the subject studies the painter. It's a three-way mirror between audience, Rush and Lord. But such existential twists are not enough to elevate this film to a level of great meaning. Viewers enthralled by this field of art might enjoy the story but most others may struggle. It's like a moment in time that lasts nineteen weeks, then compressed into ninety minutes. There is little to look forward to as the ending has no more meaning than the beginning but is far more welcomed.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

For starters, the screenplay was flawed from the comic book adaptation for leaving too many holes that were needed to help the viewer surmise the premise. Whether those details were edited out to maintain the films length (a huge mistake - the extra information was needed) or the screenplay was actually flawed, those are the major contributors for holding back this film in being great. Having a background in psychology, I understood what was happening, but I know it wouldn't have been clear enough for the average person. What this film really needed is a little more back story throughout the film as well as some pertinent details that were missed. Some scenes were overly dramatic and could have been toned down and explained better. Somewhere towards the middle of the film, it should have been made clear that this was an example of typical child like Barbara's psychological response to use their imaginations to deal with stress in lieu of logic and experience they find in adulthood. For many young people, getting caught up in a fantasy is the only way they can cope, and eventually confront, a troubling reality - a reality that should also have been made a little clearer in advance, not at the very end. This would have made the film more audience-friendly, instead of leaving them scrambling to their own conclusions of what the premise of this film is. The only other way to have clarity for this film is to have known that the comic books were written for children to help them cope with their mother's dealing and suffering with breast cancer and their eventual loss.Aside from that, director Anders Walter did an outstanding job in his first full length feature film directorial debut. The cinematography was on point, the VFX outstanding, the score appropriate and the acting was perfect by all cast members.

Their problems and conflicts seem very important for themselves, but are often difficult to understand for bystanders. This is also true for writer-director C\u00e9dric Klapisch's latest, slow-burning but quite nice drama about the importance of family and the power of forgiving. The short summary feels sugary, and Klapisch does aim for feel-good, but the movie does not try to manipulate with audience in any tasteless way. It is actually realistic depiction of well-behaved and intelligent family's life, where everybody has their problems but these are not solved in overtly dramatic way often expected from family sagas. This subtle approach doesn't make for very engaging drama, but the feel-good factor is important part of the movie. If you care to invest yourself in these characters' lives, you will probably feel like a part of their group in their end. Which is the best thing this kind of movie can ask for.

The landscape of Burgundy beautifully filmed during all the seasons of the year is the setting of a story whose heroes are people who not only make a living from wine, but wine is all they know and want to do, a tradition that they inherited for many generations, on properties that pass from grandfather to father to son and daughters. It's beautifully filmed, with a lot of technical and craft details, described with respect and dedication. I love wine, so I liked very much this facet of the film. Yet, 'Ce qui nou lie' is more than this.Director C\u00e9dric Klapisch demonstrated in previous movies like (especially) L'auberge espagnole or Chinese Puzzle that he knows and likes to build family and relationship melodramas, with credible characters that he makes us care about. This is what he also tries to do here, but in this case he seems to gather too many intrigues that do not fit that well one with the other: we have an over-the-years brothers reunion, a father-son relation that keeps being strained over the years and even after the death of the father, a land inheritance under pressure because of the decisions of the late father and taxes and economic pressure, generation conflicts and kids at the other side of the planet, etc. Some of these are better described, other are solved by sudden and less credible script writing tricks, my overall feeling was that none was that much important and you end asking yourself what was more important - the stories or the beautiful background and the style of life of the characters.Fortunately, the film is helped by splendid acting. The roles of the three siblings are trusted to three actors I know less or not at all, Pio Marma\u00ef, Ana Girardot, and Fran\u00e7ois Civil and all three do a fine job. A few of the camera moves are really memorable (the departing silhouettes of the three brothers right after a flashback that showed them hugging together with their mother many years before, the bed scene with the elder brother and his girlfriend separated and brought together at the same time by their 5 years kid). Overall it's a satisfying film, with charming moments, a little too long, but there are more reasons than the love of wine to go and see it.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Don't get me wrong, it's an important topic, a dark part of history that shall never be forgotten and a thematic that is sadly still relevant nowadays. However, so many novels and movies have already explored the exact same approach presented in this film: Au revoir les enfants, Life is Beautiful, The Book Thief, The Diary of Anne Frank and Schindler's List are only some movies that immediately come to my mind. Instead of getting another similar scenario, it would have been interesting to follow the torn family of collaborators in this film for example. Another fresh change could have been to finally offer the perspective of young German soldiers manipulated by propaganda and disillusioned by war. Since this is a French movie, it's also a little bit too convenient to simply blame the foreign enemy and would have been much more interesting to investigate the crimes of Marshal P\u00e9tain in depth. Why not make a movie about revolting French antisemitism in the Dreyfus Affair? Or a movie about France's own racist attitude in their colonies? Instead of trying out anything new, A Bag of Marbles plays it safe and the fact that the novel and movie are based upon true events doesn't help much. On the positive side, the acting performances by the teenagers incarnating the two brothers are stellar. The changes of locations keep the movie entertaining and give it an epic touch. The addition of numerous quirky side characters who are trying to find ways to hide their fears adds diversity to the film. There are a few memorable scenes such as the father beating up his own son to teach him how to deny his identity, the younger brother stepping up to save a family of collaborators in an act of civic courage and the same character desperately running after his desperate sweetheart whose family just got attacked by an angry mob.On the other side, the story doesn't offer anything new, is slightly dull and slow-paced in the middle section and only touches the surface of several interesting characters such as the Jewish doctor or the family of collaborators. Several chapters from the novel aren't included in the cinematic adaptation and a few details are also changed. Instead of showing the brothers endlessly wandering across mountains, the film should have spent more time developing the numerous interesting side characters and giving some additional information about the historic background.In the end, A Bag of Marbles is ultimately a good film but suffers from being just another movie about the fate of a Jewish family during the Second World War. The movie itself has its reasons to be, has a quirky and epic approach going for it and convinces with two really good lead actors. However, European cinema has been saturated with movies of this kind over the past three decades and this film fails both to offer anything new and to compete with its numerous competitors. The most authentic, gripping and sinister movie of this kind is the outstanding The Pianist. But if you really want to get an idea of the horrors of the Second World War, you have to visit a former concentration camp which is an absolutely life-changing experience.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The older Justin (Justin Benson) has vivid and terrible memories of their time with the group, but younger Aaron (Aaron Moorhead)has just hazy memories of pleasant times. So, despite Justin's wishes, the two do in fact return to the compound they left a decade earlier. But why are they being summoned back? Are their lives (again) in danger? Or has the cult changed into just being another Northern California commune? When the brothers arrive in the middle of nowhere, they find the de facto leader Hal (Tate Ellington), who explains that the group has prospered in the years since Aaron and Justin left. Their primary source of income? Homemade beer. Very hipster. The members of the small commune/cult each have their own special skill, whether it's painting, knitting, magic tricks. The list is pretty finite, actually.But it isn't too long before things get a little unsettling. No spoilers here; the cult believes there is an all-powerful deity who exists only for them \u2013 i.e., not a God from any other religion. This entity sends the group messages via cassette tapes and Polaroid photos. The group members pass this all off as normal; to be truthful, I found their happiness to be a bit unsettling. But Aaron, the younger/more impressionable of the brothers, wants to believe and is definitely looking for some structure in his life after a decade of menial jobs and no real direction. His wiser brother Justin, is strongly skeptical, but certain events do make him question his own sense of righteousness.So this seems like a pretty straightforward story, doesn't it? Maybe there's something to the cult's thinking, maybe they're really just harmlessly living off the grid. But then a few somethings happen, and the movie switches from being about a crazed cult into being about, well, the neverending loop of reality. And that's when the movie really takes off. I'm talking about mindbending twists and some terrific special effects. Just like that, the plot zooms from just sort of floating about, intriguing but not enticing, and then it blasts into overdrive. And suddenly nothing makes sense, and everything makes sense. It's a huge trip.For that reason, I really enjoyed this movie, the third I saw at this year's Spooky Movie International Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland.

On the surface, it is a taut, well-crafted horror story about a (possible) \"death cult\". We have some mysterious rituals, a missing husband, and seemingly silly camp activities that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 have a darker purpose.Some of this is vaguely alluded to in the opening quote from H. P. Lovecraft, and further still during the lake \"reveal\". The scare quotes here are just because what is revealed at this moment is entirely up to the imaginations of the viewer. A certain Lovecraft story may provide a guide, or it may be merely a coincidence or red herring. But once the big reveal comes, everything goes dark, and the suspense truly becomes horror.The subcutaneous level is focused on a theme: the truth of religion, either this one or religion in general. Though this film really only explores the reality of one (fictional) religion, it does make us wonder: what if some religions we find strange are actually right? With so many religions in the world, it is certainly possible that one or more are correct. And if the strangest ones might be right, we ought to question our own beliefs: do we believe correctly? With so many choices, it is hard to say for sure.Though this deeper meaning may not have been intentional, it nevertheless exists and makes the film even more interesting. The filmmakers previously had a hit with \"Resolution\" (2012), but all signs point to \"The Endless\" being an even bigger success.

From the first moment I met them I liked the characters, Grace and her Mom and I became joyously lost to this story. I say joyously even though cancer is the catalyst for all that is to be. This film is not about cancer, it's about spirit, love and hope. Getting Grace is about a young lady with cancer who in seeking to find answers to what the world and her mom will be like without her manages to touch the many lives she meets along the way leaving their lives a bit better for knowing her and each other. She discovers on her journey that her quirky self will be missed and loved and that her life does matter. It's sweet, sad at times and uplifting. She (Grace) asks questions we think but do not say aloud sometimes. She is brave and hesitant hoping for the best and she is strong and honest, she brings out the best in those whose lives touch hers.

The title character, Grace (an outstanding performance by newcomer Madelyn Dundon), is a pebble in a lake and the ripples of her life touch those around her. It's not too often that you see a funeral director in a film that is not a cliche, but Daniel Roebuck (who, impressively, wore 3 hats here, co-writer, star and director) gives an honest and believable portrayal of the funeral director that makes the interaction with Grace real which sets up some funny but also very tender moments. Overall, the movie is sweet, sensitive but also very funny and that speaks to the care that went in to the script that kept the story grounded in real life which, day to day, under normal circumstances, sees joy and laughter turn to tears and sorry. Some movies about a tragic death may be hard to watch, but Getting Grace is handled so beautifully, that to me, it is a movie I can't wait to share with friends.

Because the screenplay of 'Les fant\u00f4mes d'Isma\u00ebl' is a mess, the film is a failure. What is undoubtedly meant as an intelligent multi-layered story highlighting the many aspects in the life of a film maker, is in reality an incomprehensible hodgepodge of subplots going nowhere.Right from the very beginning, the viewer is confused. The first few scenes are not scenes from the film we're watching, but from a film within the film, which is being shot by lead character Isma\u00ebl. The main plot item, however, is the return of his wife, who has been missing for 20 years and was presumed dead. This in itself can be fine material for a well-acted drama, exploring the way the husband, his girlfriend and his long lost wife cope with this new situation. With multiple award winning actresses like Charlotte Gainsbourg and Marion Cotillard on hand, this would seem to be the most logical option.Instead, the viewer is offered a myriad of increasingly complicated side-stories, flash backs and dream-like sequences, culminating in a laughable scene of the tormented film maker shooting his own executive producer by accident.

{"imdbId": "tt1677720", "movieTitle": "Ready Player One", "title": "An Instant Classic", "author": "ArchStanton1862", "postedDate": "20 March 2018", "reviewContent": "I honestly didn't think that Spielberg had another crowd-pleasing actioner left in him. For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?This film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the \"real\" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.I have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out \"form of a gundam\" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky (\"Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky\" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).But to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.The characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \nAnd I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to\nwrite a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

He has been labeled both a peddler of popcorn and a saccharine manipulator (Those who say the latter have clearly forgotten Alex Kitner erupting in a geyser of blood in Jaws, exploding Nazi heads, the horrors of the Holocaust in Schindler and the river of corpses in War of the Worlds). There are two Spielbergs. \nThere's the man who makes somber, academy award winning dramas (Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, Munich, War Horse, Lincoln etc). Then's there's the 10 year old playing in the sand box (The Indy films, Hook, Jurassic Park, Tintin etc). What I enjoy most about the 'Berg, is how he can zigzag between disparate genres. \nBut after a stretch of SF films (A.I, Minority Report and War of the Worlds), I was looking forward to a return to the free wheeling fun with Crystal Skull. It turned out to be an uncharacteristic dud that despite the boffo box office, proved to be deeply unpopular with fans of the series.This made me cautious about Ready Player One. Had Spielberg lost his touch? \nI was wrong. This may be one of the most visually amazing and effortlessly fun films I've seen in a long time. I have not read Ernest Cline's novel, so fans of the popular novel may have issues, but I rarely read the books before seeing the film. The cast are great. Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles. Alan Silvestri's robust score is one of his most memorable. I miss John Williams, but it's still a great score. Longtime 'Berg collaborator Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is beautiful. And it's the only film where you'll see a DeLorean chasing a T-Rex on the big screen.

Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, \"the stacks,\" where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.The book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.The thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch.

{"imdbId": "tt6652708", "movieTitle": "God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness", "title": "best of the bunch", "author": "Dave McClain", "postedDate": "2 April 2018", "reviewContent": "\"God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness\" (PG, 2:00), also referred to as \"God's Not Dead 3\", is the third movie in the GND franchise, but the series is... evolving. 2014's \"God's Not Dead\" was mainly about attempting to prove God's existence academically (in a series of debates between a college student and his atheist professor). 2016's \"God's Not Dead 2\" tried to prove it in a courtroom, within the context of a plot that was more involved (but ridiculously unrealistic). This third GND film goes even further into concentrating on story development and abandons any attempt to prove God's existence through facts and logic. In this one, the director and writer of the first two are replaced by writer-director Michael Mason. It's Mason's first feature in any capacity, but his efforts give us the best executed GND yet.The film picks up immediately following the post-credits scene in \"2\" in which Reverend David Hill (David A.R. White) is arrested for refusing a court order to turn over transcripts of his sermons. David's brief incarceration is fodder for news and talk shows, carrying forward the GND narrative that Christianity is under siege in modern America. David's church has become a source of political and social division in this small-town Arkansas community - and for the (fictional) college on whose land the church stands.When a female coed named Keaton (Samantha Boscarino) breaks up with her boyfriend, Adam (Mike C. Manning), over religious differences, Adam takes out his frustrations by throwing a brick through a window of David's church. That single impulsive act has unintended but serious consequences which give the college an excuse to offer David a check to buy the building - and to use an eminent domain claim to try to force him to accept. This sets up a battle royale (legal and otherwise) between the pastor and one of his best friends, Hadleigh University chancellor Thomas Ellsworth (Ted McGinley). David gets his estranged brother, Pearce (John Corbett), to take a reluctant break from his Chicago law practice and come down to Arkansas to help. But in spite of all the help David gets from his irreligious brother, and the support he gets from his new girlfriend (Jennifer Taylor), he wonders why he hasn't heard from God.\"God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness\" is more enjoyable, more relatable and more relevant than the previous GND movies. This one isn't nearly as preachy as the others (not even allowing anyone a comforting \"He's with Jesus now\" when a main character dies), settling for trying to prove God's not dead by showing how alive he is in the lives of his followers. In doing so, Mason puts forth a story that is dramatic and accessible enough for a broader audience to appreciate - including well-written dialog and excellent acting. In the end, the film's point of view is very clear, along with an even more wide-ranging message about the need for listening over talking, unity over divisiveness and love over hate. \"B+\"", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

This is a great film about growing older and learning to enjoy it. It's a film with happiness, sadness, joy and disappointment.

{"imdbId": "tt4538916", "movieTitle": "Finding Your Feet", "title": "a gentle Brit-com laced with upper-class ridicule and feminist self-discovery", "author": "CineMuseFilms", "postedDate": "26 February 2018", "reviewContent": "It is said that American comedy laughs at people whereas British comedy laughs with them. Whether you agree or not, there is a difference and it is difficult to define. A late-life marriage break-up, two deaths, two funerals, and dementia might sound serious but they are perfect comedic fodder in Finding Your Feet (2018), a gentle British rom-com laced with upper-class ridicule and feminist self-discovery.After four decades of marriage respectability, Lady Sandra Abbott (Imelda Staunton) discovers that her husband has been having a long-term affair with her best friend. She storms into the life of her hippie older sister Bif (Celia Imrie) seeking refuge in her modest flat on a London council estate. In true British style, she dearly clings to her title until she realises the locals don't give a toss about uppity types. Just when she despairs about her future, she revives a passion for dancing and glimmers of romance appear in the most unlikely places. The local dance class becomes a touring troupe that includes her sister, a scruffy romantic named Charlie (Timothy Spall) and the hilariously haughty Jackie (Joanna Lumley). Meanwhile 'Lady' Sandra reverts to ordinary Sandra as she discovers that life can begin again at any age.Films like this give divorce an attractive name. Depending on how existential you want to be, the story can be about the innate power to find yourself in the most adverse circumstances or, on the other hand, a barrel of smirks about the idiosyncrasies of the British class system, the joys of getting older and wiser, and the role of fun in living well. The casting is impeccable and their performances are A-class as you would expect in a quality British production. Although the ensemble are uniformly excellent, Imelda Staunton and Timothy Spall are the standout duo as they depict polar opposite social types who find themselves in each other.The same plot with a younger cast might struggle, but somehow watching older people dismantle and rebuild their joy of life under the wet blanket of British social conventions is always amusing. There are no outrageous laughs nor are people or situations held to ridicule. The film's pleasure comes entirely from an intelligent script that makes wry observations of life's ironies and people's peculiarities. It's not all funny, but the tears and sad moments are brief. The delightfully corny ending ensures you leave this warm-hearted film feeling good.\n", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

In other words, it elevates working class melodrama into art house heavy while retaining the hint of desperate housewives of any small town.Almost 40-year old Chris (Jay Duplass) has been released from prison after 20 years with the aid of his do-gooder former teacher, Carol (Edie Falco). Arriving in Granite Falls, Washington State, he is faced with hitherto unsuspected expectations from the two leading ladies: Carol and her daughter Hildy (Kaitlyn Dever). A brief brush with another lady reminds us that a handsome bachelor, recently released from prison for being innocent, is fair game for romantically inclined small-town women.Shelton's approach is to let the realism dominate without veering too sharply into contrived, ironic situations. Chris's adjustment into civilian life will be fraught with suspicion and jealousy, just as in the real world his siblings and friends have always lived. Falco and Duplass are so believably good as two adults who need to start life over that you miss the clich\u00e9s and unsurprising turns because the leads become family whose fates matter very much to us.Outside In is not kitchen-sink drama; it is simply simple life warm, troubled, and endearing.

No action film special effects here! The actor's skill, along with the direction by Lynn Sheldon, and some unique additions from the musical score, is what makes Outside In an outstanding film.The story centers on Chris (Jay Duplass), a recently released convict, who was convicted and sent to prison at 18 years of age. He served 20 years to keep his brother Ted's (Ben Schwartz) involvement in a crime a secret and Ted out of jail. His former high school teacher Carol (Edie Falco), kept in contact with Chris while he was in prison and worked for his early release. Carol is the second primary character in the movie. She is an English teacher and a person that is in a long and dreary marriage. She has also grown distant from the third primary character of the movie, her teenage daughter Hildy (Kaitlyn Dever). Carol's dreary marriage situation, and distance relationship to Hildy, is at least partially caused by the time Carol has devoted to helping Chris. Hildy is somewhat withdrawn from the world, and perhaps lonely, but takes refuge in her art, perhaps not realizing the artistic talent she possesses. Carol's husband Tom (Charles Leggett) seems to feel his marriage to Carol is supposed to be dreary at this point in their lives. Chris's brother Ted (Ben Schwartz), whose life seems to be a continuous party. He appears to be guilt ridden because of Chris's prison sentence that protected him, his infrequent contact with Chris while Chris was in prison, and his inability to do anything meaningful with his life during the 20 years of freedom Chris's prison term has allowed him to have. Ted's incapability to reestablish a relationship with Chris takes away Chris's most likely potential emotional support relationship and leaves him somewhat isolated.Adding to Chris's challenges is his arrested emotional development, caused by being in prison since the age of 18. It creates issues with his relationship with Carol - as well as with Hildy. Chris and Hildy in many ways are at the same emotional developmental level and bond because of it. Ironically the common emotional level of Chris and Hildy causes separate, but similar, emotional missteps in their relationships with others.The film is filled with numerous situations (some humorous, some sad) where Chris needs to adjust to current technology, culture and history that are a result of being away and in prison for 20 years. The situations feel very real and not contrived for the movie's entertainment purposes.The movie progresses at a steady pace and the viewer doesn't realize they are being swept along in what, at the end of the movie, seems to have been a very real and believable representation of a true life story. A very believable story that could have been about a family member, a friend, or someone you know. The performance by Edie Falco (Carol) is outstanding, with every spoken line, facial expression and action seemingly very believable and true to life. Carol is a type of character that has not been a typical Falco role in the past. Her performance shows another dimension to her skills and is a credit to her career. Kaitlyn Dever (Hildy) also delivers the same outstanding level of performance - but with less screen time devoted to her character. Dever again shows that she is clearly skilled beyond her years and should have a brilliant career ahead of her. Jay Duplass (Chris) also delivers a strong performance but perhaps not demonstrating some of the same nuanced drama capability as Falco and Dever.This is a film well worth viewing and a pleasure to watch. Perhaps Shelton's best film to date. Overall a very strong recommendation.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It is a timely documentary in this era where Republican domination of the federal government, and there absurd anti-regulation crusade merely encourage more such fleecing of the public.Principal whistleblower here is a Pennsylvanian by way of Flint, Michigan (famed as the home of veteran movie muckraker Michael Moore) named Dan David, who declares at the outset of the show that there are no good guys depicted, himself included. He headed up an investment firm that helped push several new Chinese companies on the Big Board, only later to discover that their profits and vast growth were fictional. The gimmick started with Reverse Mergers, whereby a company would merge into an SEC registered company of old that was inactive, say a 19th Century mining corporation. That trick circumvented the due diligence necessary for a new company to gain a stock listing, and creepy folks here in the U.S. took it from there.Location footage shot secretly in China show how phony the supposdly booming companies actually were, and interviewees take us through the potentially dry financial machinations that come alive under Jed's direction. Dramatic highpoint occurs when former presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark walks off the set during his interview, rightfully realizing it will put him in a bad light as ex-CEO of one of the misbehaving investment banks.Ultimately I suspect the ongoing wave of Republican party and right-wing propaganda will overwhelm this film or any other's message, in favor of advancing the shibboleths that ending government supervision (read: \"interference\") with the free market will solve all ills.

After introducing a gun, director Aaron Katz has nowhere else to go according to convention other than to have the weapon return with its bloody purpose.The thriller part is set, now, to be augmented by recurring motifs of friendship and loyalty, and something of a gay immediacy, lesbian to be precise. While the principals and their pals flirt with possibilities, the film is noir, after all, and requires detective work to flesh out the murderer with the attendant bad guys and girls and bleak setting.The surprisingly low-key denouement with no appreciable thematic commentary leaves the mystery solved but weightless in human terms. Even a gloss of the industry's shallow hucksterism and uncontrollable ambitions would have been appreciated. In the end, loyalty is the trump card that will propel the actors into another film with the same challenges and disappointments. Hollywood lives one despite intrigues and occasional murders.

The movie is directed and written by Aaron Katz (\"Land Ho!\", \"Cold Weather\", \"Quiet City\") and stars Zo\u00eb Kravitz as a Hollywood starlet, Lola Kirke as her personal assistant and John Cho as a detective investigating a murder.Heather Anderson (Kravitz) is a movie star, but she doesn't seem very happy about it. She has decided that she doesn't feel like doing a movie about which she is about to have a meeting in a restaurant. She sends Jill (Kirke), her assistant and best friend, to tell the producer the news. After the producer storms off, Heather comes in and sits down, where she is approached by a young woman who insists on joining the two women in their booth and asking Heather very personal questions. In the midst of all this, Jill fields a phone call from another actor who is very angry with Heather about something (threatening Heather) - and the women have to deal with a paparazzo who's so persistent, they know him by name.When they finally leave the restaurant, Heather wants to stop by Jill's place and asks to borrow Jill's gun so she'll feel safer.

{"imdbId": "tt4702826", "movieTitle": "Birthmarked", "title": "nature vs nurture", "author": "David Ferguson", "postedDate": "30 March 2018", "reviewContent": "Greetings again from the darkness. Billed as a comedy, the movie will leave most viewers wondering wherefore art the laughs. Filmmaker Emanuel Hoss-Desmarais and his co-writer Marc Tulin aim high with a grown-up level look at the trials and tribulations of parenting - complicated here by a science experiment gone awry. Matthew Goode plays Ben, the son of a long line of renowned scientists, and Toni Collette plays Catherine, the daughter of two noted physicists. The two nerds (a term of admiration) meet in graduate school, fall in love, and hatch a plan to conduct a revolutionary sociological scientific experiment. In 1977 they convince an arrogant and glory-seeking rich guy named Gertz (Michael Smiley) to fund an experiment with a premise that boils down to their intention of settling the nature vs. nurture debate once and for all.Ben and Catherine plan to take their biological son Luke and turn him into an artist, while at the same time raising two adopted kids contrary to their genetic heritage. Maya, born into a family of \"nitwits\" will be raised as a Brainiac, while Maurice, born into a violent household, will be developed as a pacifist. It's an interesting set-up that also includes Russian athlete Samsonov (Andreas Apergis) as their live-in caregiver/nanny, and Mrs. Tridek (Fionnula Flanagan) as Gertz's well-meaning assistant.The story jumps ahead to 1989 when Gertz arrives for the 12 year check-up and evaluation. When he deems the children to be \"average\", Ben and Catherine are devastated. Gertz threatens them with bankruptcy if the experiment isn't successfully expedited so he can publish the desired results. Mrs. Tridek also functions as the narrator who fills in the gaps with some details that might ordinarily leave us a bit confused. Predictability rears its ugly head in the final act, and the film slips into more traditional cinematic story-telling and characterizations. Emotions and greed are the natural responses to the deception that has occurred, and while the adults leave us disappointed, it's at this point where the story finally shifts to the kids and we get to see the winner in the nature vs. nurture battle. Where the film works best is in its look at just how powerful and overwhelming parenting can be, regardless of the brain power and intentions one brings to the situation. Toss in some greed and the power of biology, and the final analysis can't be shocking, even if the film itself doesn't quite live up to its premise.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt4702826", "movieTitle": "Birthmarked", "title": "This film is a failed experiment !!!", "author": "TARUN VERMA", "postedDate": "7 May 2018", "reviewContent": "This is what all happens in the film:\n1) Two scientists (Ben and Catherine) marry, and decide to raise kids as an experiment to prove power of nurture over nature. One would be their own son, Luke, with scientific inheritance but would be raised as an artist. Another one would be the daughter (Maya) of ordinary middle class people but would be raised as an intellectual. The third one, Maurice, with family history of violence and anger would be raised as a pacifist in Gandhian ideology.2) They approach a rich man (Mr. Gertz) who is interested in science and ask for funds. He agrees as he finds their idea groundbreaking.3) They raise the children on a secluded country-side house which belongs to Ben's forefathers. One of them is an assistant (Samsonov) hired by Gertz to help the family as well as keep a record of \"parenting experiment\".4) The experiment goes wrong and children become frustrated by their parents and their ways of treating them. Specially the father who is focused on doing anything in the name of science (showing his son pornographic pics of nude women and ask him to convert his sexual desire by performing a dance while looking at the pics) while the mother is shocked to see their moral behaviors (they act out a sex scene while performing a play from a pornographic novel), especially their sexual development and thoughts.5) Mother becomes ill, possibly depressed, and her doctor advises to go on a leave of few days outside their residence. After some clashes between the parents, they decide for the holiday. While this trip is being planned, children decide to run away from house and injure parents and the assistant by the car.6) Court takes away the kids and sends them to a special care school while parents separate from each other. Meanwhile, Gertz tells them that the parents have to pay him $1.4 million as the experiment has failed. He also discloses another experiment that he was doing on Morin family with the help of Samsonov, where he was recording the behaviors of parents and the whole family. So he puts another choice in front of them. They have to sign a document where they will have no objection to whichever way Gertz publishes the results of his two experiments. If they accept this condition, they he will relieve them of that repay of fund money. They both agree to this.7) The story takes a turn when through a book, the kids come to know about the experiment their parents were doing on them. Parents apologize to them and the family reunites.The film lacks emotions, becomes boring, is highly predictable, and does not excite at any point. Ben is a very lethargic character, who seems over-exhausted throughout the movie, as if he is doing some great science which is not shown anywhere. Except few places like where he does a maze experiment where he sets up a furnace and asks the daughter to move a rat through the maze and decide which direction rat has to take. One of her decisions throws the rat in the furnace and the girl screams out of guilt and fear. The experiment looked even poorer than a 6th grade model. Most lacking thing from the movie was almost zero depictions of any real experimental stuff. There was really no science anywhere. Catharine, the mother, looked like a typical mother throughout the movie, and not any great scientist doing some family experiment. She is a worried mother, who is concerned about her children getting aggressive or displaying immoral sexual acts. She is bothered about where this whole experiment thing is going and doesnt find herself comfortable in continuing this \"science\". Then she gets depressed by all the family stress and decides to take medicines. Her husband is careless and does weird science discussions or has those thoughts. She seems to be the one who is concerned in putting family together and father is following her all the time. Ben is a confused scientist and a confused father who doesn't have any clue to what he is doing. He reads about some new scientific finding and begins to implement on the kids, which obviously kids dislike (like giving beans for dinner and throwing away TV).The movie brings issues of ethical science into discussion when Gertz threatens Morin family with the publication of his findings regarding the sort of experiment he was attempting on the Morins. His experiment sounded unethical and cruel. The best part is that the film makes a satire on scientific researches involving humans and capitalist market exploiting science for its own needs. Gertz is a rich man with enough money inherited to invest in science. But he cares least about any good science and in turn wants to earn fame and recognition through unethical practices. He is apathetic to the emotions of a family for the sake of his pride and fame. He exploits scientists as well as a family. Overall, the movie is a good watch, a different story and a must watch. Film justifies family bonds and emotional ties over the abstract ideology of science. There are certain elements inherent to human nature which science can not capture under any objective lens. More than nurture vs nature, it was film about subjectivity vs objectivity, real vs abstract, and science vs emotions. The kids turn out to be different from what their parents were experimenting for. Finally it was the personal experience that wins in the end, and neither nature nor nurture.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I knew this because first, there were several instances in which scenes interrupted other scenes without rhyme or reason. This implies that several scenes were, in my opinion, cut short. There were also times when the camera lingered too long on a subject, e.g., Andie McDowell. Related to this was the omission of what probably should have been included, specifically, the consequences of every time Chris O'Dowd's character, Nicholas, cheated on his then lover. In both cases, he just moved along, and whatever consequence there was, was minimal, and the film just progressed to his next involvement.Then, there is the story line. I kept seeing an elephant in the room that no one was talking about and that was the Oedipal thing going on between Andie M. and Chris O'Dowd, as mother and son. Perhaps another film will grow out of this subject that was glaringly there and ignored. It almost felt as if the writer/director couldn't decide what should be the main story line, the emotional aftermath of the death of a family's husband/father, or the Oedipal relationship between the mother and son of that family which was highlighted once the father died.Overall, as someone who can never watch too many \"relationship movies\", I am glad I saw Love After Love and look forward to Harbaugh's next.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

This is the director's first feature, and it shows. By turns maudlin, self-congratulatory and incoherent, the story purports to be an examination of how an aging gay man - who lived through the worst years of AIDS - now finds himself in a time in which his activism is under-appreciated. Unfortunately, as written, the protagonist (Sam) is self-absorbed and unlikable, a privileged New York artist who treats the hustlers he hires badly and who whines relentlessly to others that, for some reason, put up with him. He is, essentially, a narcissist that the filmmakers present as if he were sympathetic.The conceit of the film is that Sam is not afforded by young, cute gay guys the respect and honor he deserves for having lost friends and loved ones in the eighties and for having participated in Act Up in the nineties. As a survivor of those times myself, I appreciate the work of activists, but I fully understand that what they accomplished should be gratification enough. Of course younger gay men can't understand what Sam went through. The whole point was to work toward a future when they wouldn't have to. Sam is stuck in the past, as is the film. The protagonist seems to learn nothing, and watching his journey becomes increasingly frustrating.One final point (and this truly bothered me): throughout the film, Sam voices particular venom toward the few non-white characters - a latino hustler he stiffs, a black artist who has replaced him in popularity, and the latino boyfriend of an old friend who the friend wishes to marry. This isn't quibbling; his behavior is pronounced and consistent, leaving the impression that, in his mostly-white world, people of color are people to be disparaged.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The story unfortunately is told in a very slow pace and in a rather uninteresting manner. The only scene that is poignant is the argument scene at the dinner gathering. Those five minutes are really the only minutes that stand out from the rest. I find myself wondering when the film is ending, and indeed why the film is not ending. The film feels very long, and drags on and on at the end. The film could have stopped right after the party started.

Sam's homosexuality is very political: a veteran of the gay rights protests and anti-bigotry campaigns of decades ago, he embraces the self-imposed outsider, 'rage against the machine' status it affords him, as witnessed by his tirade against a gay couple who marry. But it's not all politics: one night he takes home a young man (Zachary Booth) he meets in a bar. Their relationship is the hook on which the film hangs a wider examination of Sam's life.So far, so talky American gay movie. What saves the film is the acting. I agree with Samuel L Jackson - why hire a Briton to play an American - were all the American actors busy? But there is no doubt Cumming is good in this, eschewing the queenliness he sometimes uses and instead delivering a character who is a strong, opinionated, not-particularly-likable ordinary guy. As for Booth, while he has the looks of a vapid Valley boy, he turns in a natural, realistic performance as the younger man intrigued by the older man, but not blinkered to the latter's faults. Amongst the supporting roles, Everett Quinton has fun as the ageing, gently flamboyant queen who is the oldest of the circle of friends.So full marks for the acting, but considerably fewer for originality.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

He treats everyone badly; he does not discriminate on gender, gender identity or race. I am not troubled by the slow pace of character development because his inflexibility is a function of his age.

I want to get that statement out of the way first.Three girls who have been best friends since elementary school agree to each have sex with their dates on prom night. Their parents catch wind of the plan and decide that they must stop this from happening. They play the role of blockers. That's really all you need to know about the plot. This movie is fueled by the characters, all of which are more layered than they first seem. Look out for Ike Barinholtz's moment in the third act. And John Cena's. And Leslie Mann's. Heck, every featured character has at least one impressive dramatic moment. But let's be clear-this is a comedy. Several scenes in this movie had me absolutely cracking up, and I was far from the only viewer laughing that hard. One guy started wheezing and even exclaimed, \"oh man, this is too much; I can't breathe!\" Then the crowd laughed even more. All of this uproarious laughter from a movie that contains no comedy stars. It's rare. Btw, I have nothing but love for Leslie Mann (a comedy standout, not quite a star) and John Cena (a star, perhaps, but not yet for his comedy). Then I realized something. There are comedy stars in this movie. They just haven't become stars yet. What I'm saying is, remember the names and faces from this movie, especially the three daughters. In a few years you will look back and see this as their breakout moment.In addition to the humor, which is abundant, this movie has quite a bit of heart. That's what takes it up a level. Each parent-daughter relationship feels real and lived in. This helps viewers who are not already parents themselves understand what these parents are going through.When one daughter asks why sex is so bad (a totally reasonable question), her dad stammers for a moment, then says he doesn't know. It's tough to explain. The movie wisely doesn't take this conversation any further. If it had, the conversation would have become preachy. Her dad has an answer, but it's a long, complicated and messy one. The scene (and the movie) works better without attempting to provide this messy explanation.That's a line that the writers walk carefully and successfully. They say just enough to provide both sides of thought on why the parents want so desperately to stop their daughters. Are they wrong to manically chase their daughters down? Well, yeah. Are they wrong to want to protect them? Not at all. That's what this blocking attempt is really about. Protecting their daughters. To the parents, sex is a step into adulthood and all its problems. They just want their daughters to stay safe and innocent as long as they can. It's a warm message that works because it never patronizes viewers. This movie is much smarter than it looks in the trailer. I certainly didn't expect to laugh this much, think this much, or feel a lump in my throat when I saw promos for Blockers. But I did. And now I'm giving it a strong recommendation. Go see Blockers. It's a hilarious story that also manages to make you care.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Based on that, I was expecting it to be a comedy that either tried too hard to be funny and had no story or would consist of LCD (lowest common denominator) jokes that have been overused in a bunch of comedies already. I was not expecting to actually laugh at anything, and both of my friends that I saw it with had similarly low expectations, but thankfully we were all proven wrong. \"Blockers\" essentially combines the premise of \"American Pie\" with the style of \"Superbad\" and fits it well into a modern high school context. It's something we've seen a bunch of times before in high school movies: the kids want to have sex and the parents do their best to \"block\" them.\n Hardly a new premise, but the movie does a great job creating some original, character-driven jokes that do a good job making light of how parents-teenager dynamics work in a modern context. There are a lot of elements and jokes that center around emoji language and texting conventions, and they are executed in a way that actually feels realistic instead of just getting thrown in haphazardly to try to appeal to younger audiences. There are a lot of good one-liners along with some visual comedy that adds a good variety. Even though I was sort of expecting some over-the-top situational comedy, there were several scenes that had surprising reversals in them.\n There were some attempts at a couple of light themes to give the movie heart. On an emotional level, the parents are all trying to connect with their kids, and while it was good that the movie tried to make itself more than a raunchy comedy, this theme was handled in a fairly standard and even cliched way. There was also a little bit of a social statement about how people in general and parents especially view girls losing their virginity as this kind of horrific loss of innocence whereas it's not as big of a deal for boys. It wasn't really a theme so much as an argument that a couple of characters made. For spoiler reasons, I won't go into detail, but the movie is careful not to take a definite stance on whether teenagers having sex is okay.\n The characters are not totally original, but most of them are fun to watch. The three girls are all fairly different. I didn't totally buy that they were close friends, but they at least had a good contrast of personalities and were distinct. The only real problem that I had with the teenager characters was the portrayal of Sam as a lesbian. She wasn't a bad character, but the way they handled her being a lesbian just felt obsolete; not exactly offensive but it didn't feel very socially conscious. The parents are given more attention and definitely generate more laughs as they try and fail to control their kids. All of them are given a good amount of attention and provide a lot of laughs for the audience with none really out-shining the others.\n I would somewhat recommend this. It won't be the funniest movie you've ever seen, but the audience in my theater was laughing throughout the movie. It's nothing revolutionary or new, but it can make for a good study break with some friends if you're in the mood. Overall Rating: 7.2/10.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

John Krasinski, most famous for playing the role of Jim Halpert in The Office, brings us a new horror in the form of A Quiet Place, and the result is one of the most intense cinematic experiences you could wish for.Evelyn and Lee Abbott (played by real life couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski) live with their two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), on a farm. They live every day in silence to survive the threat of creatures that hunt by sound.The simplicity of the concept makes A Quiet Place such a fascinating prospect but it's the execution that excels it to soaring heights. Krasinski has crafted a horror film that grabs you in a vice-like grip from the very first shot, not letting go until the end credits start to roll, honing in perfectly on the use of sound and silence for some of the most intense sequences in recent memory.The fear factor in A Quiet Place comes from the tension and suspense Krasinski develops throughout, a true standout sequence being when a heavily pregnant Evelyn finds herself evading a creature as she goes into labour. It's moments like this one that had me gripping the arms of my seat and holding my breath numerous times throughout. Coming to the performances, A Quiet Place possesses the rarest of the rare in horror films with a cast who all deliver great performances. Parents should always be protective of their children but the situation they find themselves in here adds another layer to that and Blunt and Krasinski excel in showing the desperation they face to keep their children safe. Child actors always make me feel a little cautious going into a film however, both are very good here, Simmonds in particular. As a deaf actress, Simmonds adds an authenticity to proceedings and her performance is one not to be overlooked.There were a few scenes I wish Krasinski had elaborated on more but those are just a few minor issues I had that can take a back seat to the ingenuity shown in the crafting of a horror film that has the makings of a classic. It's worth noting that the entire audience was in total silence throughout, a sign that this film is well and truly having the desired effect.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt6644200", "movieTitle": "A Quiet Place", "title": "Shh...", "author": "imew", "postedDate": "22 April 2018", "reviewContent": "\"I love you. I've always loved you.\"These are the last words signed by John Krasinski's character (Lee Abbott) in his directorial debut, A Quiet Place (2018). The audience is hit with the emotional core of the whole film, a father confessing his love for his daughter before he sacrifices himself for her life. His courageous decision answers the question that the film poses from the beginning: \"How far are parents willing to go to save their children?\" We realize that the father, even after witnessing his daughter getting her brother killed, still loves her, and would trade his own life for hers.Although it's a theme that's powerful, it's also shallow, underdeveloped, and used way too many times before. Krasinski has stated several times the film was about family, not horror, and yet he still does not expand on his theme more than: \"A parent would kill themself for their children.\" Even if it may resonate with some audience members, it's silenced in their vast collection of scenes they've seen where a person sacrifices themself for a loved one.But A Quiet Place is far from unoriginal. The premise is, quite simply, one of the greatest horror ideas I've ever heard of. The complete absence of sound creates suspense by itself, where even the slightest sound is noticed by the viewer. Thus, Krasinski possessed total control of the audience, able to manipulate what the audience predicts or doesn't. He can tell us when to be scared, when to be sad, when to look, or when to listen. Notice how Krasinski tells us a monster is near; he doesn't let us see it, but rather lets us hear noises of it thundering on the floor above them.Unfortunately, the score subtracted from the premise. During too many scenes was the music overpowering and unnecessary. Joel and Ethan Coen executed the score perfectly in their masterpiece, No Country for Old Men (2007). How? They didn't use one. It would've been interesting if A Quiet Place featured no music, but it's clear the score should've at least been eased.The atmosphere wasn't established well either. For the first half, it was ambiguous whether or not the family is alone, which is altogether unnecessary. As the audience, we adapt to an environment by learning about it, isolated or populous. When this information is withheld, we cannot fully immerse into a situation. After we encounter the suicidal old man, we realize they aren't alone, forcing us to readapt to the environment.One way of correcting this flaw was setting the film in a suburb where a neighborhood of families reside, thus also allowing additional creative possibilities. For instance, Krasinski could have the families interact and communicate, and we can see how each family evolves. Since not every family is identical, the camera can vary points of view and contrast the different lives of each family. Some families may be more sympathetic than others. Some families may be crueler than others. Maybe a father of another family was faced with the same choice Krasinski's character had; sacrificing himself for his child, or to watch his child die. And maybe he chooses the latter. Screenwriters would address this as an \"Ironic Controlling Idea\", presenting the positives and negatives of an issue. This would also add depth to the theme, and therefore patching the film's first flaw.Technically, A Quiet Place is magnificent. The performances are excellent, most notably by the young actress Millicent Simmonds. She plays the deaf daughter (Regan Abbott), and as she is deaf in real life, fits the role perfectly. She's somewhat enigmatic, but also warm hearted-so when her father confesses he loved her all along, her personality adds to the emotional punch. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are also married with two children in real life, which explains such honest performances. There's a beautiful scene in the film featuring their genuine emotions, where they slowly dance away to Neil Young's \"Harvest Moon\" in their basement. Despite the horror surrounding them, Emily (Evelyn Abbott) tenderly lends him one of her earbuds so they could temporarily exist in a world together with sound.Krasinski is a master at small touches. Not only does Evelyn's pregnancy create yet another element of suspense to the film, but the birth also serves as a metaphor for the regeneration of the family. When Evelyn leaves a nail at the end of the basement stairs, Krasinski further builds suspense by cutting to a close up of it. All hell breaks loose when Evelyn's water breaks and she steps on the nail, reassuring both anticipations. She then cleverly escapes upstairs by deflecting the monster with a timer, and lies in a bathtub to deliver the baby. Notice the composition of a superb shot where she lies in the bathtub on the left of the screen, with the staircase just to her right. As we focus on her suffering, we spot the monster's hand slowly crawl up the staircase next to her. Masterful cinematography, direction, and acting, all in one shot. Finally, after the birth, the nail at the bottom of the basement stairs is never mentioned again. We don't know if anyone took it out, but we suspect it's still there. And every time a family member walks down those stairs, we hold our breath in anticipation. Krasinski holds the shot a little while longer to tease us, but no one ever steps on it. After briefly satisfying our expectations, Krasinski manipulates us once again. From setup to aftermath, the bathtub scene is immaculate.It reminds me of a quote the legendary Alfred Hitchcock once said: \"I enjoy playing the audience like a piano.\" That is, of course, because Hitchcock was the \"master of suspense\", and his manipulation techniques are just incredible-but Krasinski is not far off. A Quiet Place is not a masterpiece-nor is it anywhere near it, but Krasinski is obviously trying. He's established himself as an up and rising talent, and we should encourage more directors like him. We should encourage the Andersons and Tarantinos, the Cuarons and Linklaters, the Nolans and Chazelles. After all, who are we if we can't protect them?", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The premise is simple, we get no back story as to why the family have to stay silent, but within 5 minutes with an unexpected moment we can see what the consequence of making noise is. From then on our focus is on this one family as they strive to stay safe in what seems like a helpless situation. \nI enjoyed this film immensely. I found it to be nerve shredding and so tense to watch i had to try catch my breath a few occasions as i had been holding it so long. It is the silence for a majority of the film that makes this work and i was grateful for a silent cinema hall (this i will go back to) I found myself caring for the characters (rare in horror) and hoping for a positive outcome. It also doesn't suffer from an overlong run time and imo is not for the mostpart predictable.Those who like a decent movie monster i feel will be pleasantly surprised i believe as well.\nThose who are looking for gory in your face horror may struggle to engage and i think coming back to my point earlier if you end up in a hall full of restless noisy people filling the silence the tension will somewhat be lost. \nA solid 8/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

And if you're present at the time, you get the gift then. Before you're old and distinguish its value in retrospect. For me that was my friend John from high school. In Director Sean McNamara's \"The Miracle Season\" that soul is Caroline, played by Danika Yarosh, who inspired greater in Kelly, played by Erin Moriarty. 17 year-old Caroline or \"Line\" is the star volleyball setter for the Iowa State Champion High School Trojans. Line sees the strength within her best friend and teammate Kelly. Caroline sees the hero within Kelly that she has yet to discern. Along with their Coach Kathy \"Bres\" Bresnahan, the Trojans commit to win the 2nd consecutive State Title, something no other school had accomplished. Spirited pretty Yarosh as Caroline is the radiant light who grants everyone friendship. Her Dad Ernie, played by William Hurt, is the surgeon and team mentor. Her Mother Ellyn, played by Jillian Fargey, suffers from terminal cancer. Caroline holds out hope that Mom will see her get married someday. Caroline tragically dies in a traffic accident before the season starts. Her Dad and Kelly, along with the entire community are devastated. Initially, strong stoic Hunt as Bres dedicates along with the team to winning the State Championship for Caroline. Sounds predictable or formulaic? Perhaps. However, unique poignancy emerges in the screenplay by David Aaron Cohan Elissa Mastueda, whose story is based on real life Iowa high school volleyball star Caroline Found, who passed away in 2015. The movie is the homage to the Trojan's \"Miracle Season\" to the State Championships.At times Cohan and Matsueda's narrative succumbs to wallowed sentimentality. Clumsy dialogue occurs especially in Coach Bres's inspirational sound bites. Perhaps, the mourning for the girls over Caroline's death indulges a tad, yet there is the sense of authentic loss. I think that authenticity of loss and looking at what someone's true legacy endears \"The Miracle Season\" even in its frailties. Erin Moriarty is a star. She has understated strength and vulnerability as Kelly. She and Helen Hunt have savior chemistry and partnership. In the great scene Kelly quietly sets the volleyball up in air with her fingers, while Coach Bres closes her eyes and listens. She knows Kelly is the one. William Hurt is beautiful humanity as the grieving father, who like Line sees the greater within Kelly. \"The Miracle Season\" is about letting go. So what is legacy? I've gotten that legacy shall be defined by others we touched in life. Yet, legacy can't be confined to the memory of the past. Legacy has value only when it is about those remaining moving forward and becoming greater. It's about regenerating the joy of those we love be it: making snow angels in the middle of nowhere. Legacy is about others, them becoming greater than they know. Toward the end, Bres tells her players that she loves them, and couldn't be prouder. She says, \"Win it for you!\" \"The Miracle Season\" touches in reminding us that we honor someone's legacy in pursuing our own greater.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The only way to understand YWNRH is through a Freudian lens. The theme of this film is not father-daughter incest as it appears, but rather mother-son incest. Joe has an incestuous relationship with his mother. \"Stay with me a little longer,\" she says when he puts her to bed. In the next scene, she is trying to cajole him into coming into the bathroom where she is naked. The multiple references to PSYCHO are not a coincidence: this too is the story of a man transformed into a serial murderer by his obscene mother. The story proper is nothing is a paranoid delusion: hence the title of the film and the mysterious \"invisibility\" of the main character.The true story: Joe, as a child, is dragged into an incestuous relationship by his mother. His father, whose job ought to be to prevent this regressive fusion, does not have the authority to separate them. He is too violent, too weak, or too absent: we never find out. All we ever see of him is a hand holding a hammer. This scene must be understood as a metaphor. Father discovers their relationship and explodes; as he rages impotently with his hammer, mother and son exchange a complicit glance under the bed. Translation of the mother's wink: \"He's impotent. You're still MINE.\" On mother's credenza is a photo of her as a young and beautiful woman and a photo of her son. Father has been eliminated from the picture. Joe rescues abused girls. This is a fantasy. No abused girl ever existed, only an abused boy. Joe invents the story of a girl abused by her father as a displacement of the true abuse: a boy by his mother. What actually happens in the movie, and what is fantasy? What actually happens is very simple. Joe murders his mother. Joe commits suicide. Perhaps the homosexual encounter in the sauna and the drugs are true. Everything else is a delusion that he creates to escape from the horror of the truth. In Joe's fantasy, he is a powerful man and not a victim. He has a benevolent father figure (McCleary). He makes ample use of the hammer which appears to be the only trace of a paternal legacy. The Nina character is how Joe sees his mother: as a beautiful, innocent, prohibited object of desire. Joe's delusion is simultaneously an attempt to understand the truth and an attempt to flee the truth. David Lynch uses this technique more explicitly in LOST HIGHWAY, MULHOLLAND DRIVE, and TWIN PEAKS. It is very effective on film and Lynne Ramsay is right to exploit it. In Joe's delusion, the father (represented by the two- dimensional Votto and Williams characters) takes \"illegal\" possession of his daughter. In reality, this is how the young Joe perceives his father's possession of his mother: as an unbearable crime that must be punished. Did Joe murder his own father? It is possible. Note that in all of Joe's traumatic flashbacks, women are being murdered, not men. These flashbacks are not real. They are irruptions of Joe's deepest fantasy: murder his mother. He never went to Iraq.One day, like Ed Kemper, Joe finally kills his mother. He is the one who shot her in the head. To exculpate himself, he flees into an unbelievable political conspiracy fantasy in which all symbolic fathers are pedophile criminals. Why is Joe so protective of his mother's privacy? Because he doesn't want anyone to find out what is going on between them. I wasn't sure the director understood her own story until the moment she replaced Joe's sinking mother with Nina. Here she could not be clearer: Nina is just a fantasy screen for Mother. In reality, Joe really does shoot himself in the diner. The fantasy of a happy future with Nina is just a screen. I have read Jonathan Ames before and the theme of maternal incest is often implied (his fascination for transsexuals is further proof of an Oedipal thematic).

The good being Joe and the bad being a lot of other people. The film has a lot of similarities with Taxi Driver, but while it carries the similarities with itself, it delivers it's own original identity in a flawless way. Lynne Ramsay's script put together with Joaquin Phoenix's performance and Johnny Greenwood's absolutely superb soundtrack, delivers to you one of the most beautiful movies of the decade, for your own and this movie's sake don't jump to conclusions with this one and give it time; for me the movie really took life in the water sequence where Joe tries to commit suicide while drowning his mom's body, but as he is in the middle of drowning he suddenly sees Nina, drowning with him. Noticing that drowning himself would automatically drown Nina too, since she has nobody to save her, and thinking she isn't strong enough to do it herself. He goes back for Nina, he kills the security guards goes inside but sees that Nina saved herself, what he may not notice at that moment was that he was the one who gave her the power to fight back and save herself, but he thinks that he just added another not-so pleasant event to the girls life making her kill someone but she assures him \"It's okay Joe, it's okay\". Because Joe might not notice it but Nina seems to notice that Joe is a nice guy, actually he is a sweetheart, he holds the hand of the guy that killed her mom when he's dying and is scared, for christ's sake.\nBoth leaves the house not knowing after all of this disturbing events will they be able to just get on with their lives? that thought is seen in the diner, where Joe shoots himself in the head while shedding two tears (a reverse type of De Niro's famous scene at the end of the Taxi Driver where he has a smile on his face a few moments before his death). If the movie ended there, Ramsay would imply that in between all of this darkness there is no brightness, it can't be found. But the movies tricks you, with Nina coming back we understand that Joe's asleep and that scene was simply just a dream, and with Nina's dialogue \"Let's go, It's a beautiful day\" Joe wonders, maybe it is a beautiful day, maybe he can put the disturbing past of his childhood with his abusive dad and the incidents of his work away. And when he sees that even if there is all of this darkness in this world you can still see the light, because you are the one who has the power and you are the one who chooses and understands without all of this darkness, the brightness would not have any meaning; and he confirms Nina, \"It is a beautiful day outside\" creating one of the most beautiful endings of cinema.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

He should get an Oscar nomination at the very least.\"You Were Never Really Here\" is a great mix of reality and delusion, driven by the central character's recurring past traumatic experiences. Perpetuation of violence in a cynical world is the main theme, and it's depicted in a very inspired and original way thanks to the top notch direction and spectacular photography (some stylish scenes are able to convey powerful feelings and messages in a far more effective way than a conventional narration would ever do).When the tension escalates, this slow-burn psychological/revenge thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat; the skillful use of editing and music really help on that aspect.Ramsay was fun, down to earth and answered many questions afterwards.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It is a documentary about the journey following one particular panda living in captivity, to its release into the wild. The movie begins when Chen Chen is just a pup, living with other baby pandas in captivity. Based on the black bear research of Ben Kilham, this lucky panda is released and followed in the wild. The American researcher, Jacob Owens and the Chinese researcher, Bi Wen Li work together to help bring Chen Chen into her natural environment. Along the journey, she has some awkward moments and challenging times. I won't tell you what they are because it would give away a big part of the movie.My favorite scene is the beginning when we see Chen Chen and the other pandas playing together. In many ways, they seem just like little kids happily playing. My other favorite scene is when Ben Kilham is playing a peek-a-boo game with a black bear behind a tree (say that 10 times fast). The music, by Mark Mothersbaugh, is really child-like, which adds to the fun playfulness that we see with the pandas. The narration by Kristen Bell is spot on with her happy tone and soothing voice throughout the film. The sweetness in her voice adds to the enjoyment of the movie. My favorite character has to be the adorable Chen Chen and also the researchers. Chen Chen is always entertaining because she is so cute, loving, has a great personality and is very curious. I especially love the part when the researchers say they will always be there for her whether it is in ten or 20 years. The message of this film is that, through research, working with others and a lot of patience, pandas and other endangered animals raised in captivity can be successfully released into the wild. The message also is that it is important to save species from extinction because \"once they're gone, they're gone\"I recommend this film for ages 5 to 18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Abigail Zoe L., KIDS FIRST!

The film uses a mix of thoughtful but down-to-earth dialogue and stunning shots of the American West to immerse the viewer in its world. These two elements manage to coexist quite well in the film. I was impressed by the quality of the acting in the film, as Haigh wisely directs his cast to choose a deep-seated and authentic sense of realism over sentimental value in their performances. The film moves at a leisurely but commendable and never tedious pace. Its tone is often quite dark at times and its themes can be quite heavy, but patient viewers who stay with the film will be rewarded. It is important to understand that thankfully, such tone and themes never feel sentimental or sappy, which is all to the film's genuine benefit. The film's depiction of poorer and rural Americans in the West provides for thoughtful and compassionate social commentary in a manner similar to something like J.D. Vance's stunning memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Haigh should be praised for ensuring that such depiction is never portrayed in a trivialized manner.My main criticism of the film--and the key element that keeps it from greatness--is that the film often plays it too safe in its narrative and stylistic choices. While the movie never feels predictable and often feels gritty, a mild philosophical change in how the film could have been constructed could have made some scenes feel somewhat less derivative. That said, this is a well-made and well-acted drama. Recommended to those interested. 7/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

His journey is about the affection he has for the race horse but its not entirely about that. His life has changed since the death of his father and it really is a tale of not knowing what to do and trying to survive in the world. The film can be somber at times and all things and characters in Plummer's characters life come and go.The film does suffer from slow passages and its long running length. Its easy to have moments where your attention wanes. Overall, the film is well made. Its a characters journey and its crazy to see how things can change so suddenly for someone. The film has a talented cast and I'd say is definitely worth a watch especially if you're a film lover who likes to watch everything.7/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt5340300", "movieTitle": "Lean on Pete", "title": "a boy and his burdens", "author": "David Ferguson", "postedDate": "12 April 2018", "reviewContent": "Greetings again from the darkness. Andrew Haigh's follow-up to his gut-wrenching 45 YEARS (2015) is \"a boy and a horse\" movie that is every bit as emotionally draining, and secures his spot as one of the best filmmakers at bringing characters we thoroughly believe to the screen. It's based on the novel by Willy Vlautin and could be described as coming-of-age, slice-of-life, or even a road movie. While it's each of these, it is also much more ... though I fear it is one of this year's indie gems that will likely slide between the cracks with far too few taking the time to experience it.Charlie Plummer was most recently seen in ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD as Getty's kidnapped grandson. Here he stars as Charley, a 15 year old boy living a half-step from poverty with his caring, but unprepared single dad (Travis Fimmel). Charley goes for morning runs around town, and his polite mannerisms include effusive praising and expressing gratitude to his dad's mistress (Amy Seimitz) for cooking a full breakfast - a rare treat for this growing teenager. Charley stumbles into part time work with has-been horse trainer Del (Steve Buscemi), a man whose career, health and demeanor have all seen better days. Horse trainer in this context is far removed from the glamour of the Kentucky Derby. Del works his horses hard for meager winnings on the county fair circuit, and when their time is up, the horses are shipped to Mexico for 'processing'.Charley and Del form a bond based on Del's cheapness and Charley's work ethic and love of the horses. When tragedy strikes, the movie shifts to a road trip vibe, with Bonnie (Chloe Sevigny) joining on as a jockey. The three are a quasi-family but mostly they are each just trying to get along in a life that isn't always kind. When Charley ignores Bonnie's advice to not get too attached to the horses, he and the titular Pete are soon trudging across the backcountry. Charley's life on the streets provides many life lessons, but not much joy. He crosses paths with an initially friendly addict named Silver (Steve Zahn), and along the trip, his childhood memories provide some hope - especially as related to Aunt Margy (Alison Elliott). These all feel like real folks that we could meet at any time. Some are helpful, yet the biggest life lesson of all comes roaring through these mostly quiet scenes - people care most about themselves.This most certainly isn't a Disney-style horse movie like DREAMER, and in fact, it's much less a horse story than it is Charley's story. The core message seems to be that no matter how gentle one's soul, human nature adapts in times of desperation. It's pure cinematic pleasure to have both Mr. Buscemi and Ms. Sevigny in the same film, but the shining light here is Charlie Plummer. With little dialogue, he conveys so much about what he is thinking and feeling. His desire is to have some stability - someone or something that he can depend on. It's the security many of us take for granted. Cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof Jonck (A WAR, 2015) beautifully captures the endless Pacific Northwest landscapes, while also managing the intimate and thoughtful moments. Mr. Haigh's two most recent films add him to my must-see list ... I just wish there were more who would find pleasure in his displays of lack of joy.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It is an odyssey of a 16-year-old boy (Charlie Plummer, \"All the Money in the World\") who becomes attached to a doomed horse and undertakes a desperate quest for support in a world that has suddenly left him alone, attempting to make sense of an America that has lost its moorings. Charley is, in poet John Banville's words, \"all inwardness, gazing out in ever intensifying perplexity upon a world in which nothing is exactly plausible, nothing is exactly what it is,\" a boy without a past or a foreseeable future.Based on a novel by Willy Vlautin and set in the Pacific Northwest, Charley lives with his single and much traveled dad (Travis Fimmel, \"Maggie's Plan\") who has come to Portland to work as a forklift driver. Unlike the quiet, polite Charley, Ray is blustery and macho, but there is no doubt about his love for his son, although he often leaves him alone. Abandoned by his mother as an infant, Charley's only other family is Aunt Margy (Alison Elliott, \"20th Century Women\") with whom he lost contact many years ago after she had a conflict with Ray over Charlie's upbringing.Out jogging to acquaint himself with the neighborhood, the boy discovers a seedy looking racetrack and strikes up a friendship with a cynical, small-time horse owner who is not averse to cutting ethical corners to make a living. Earning a few dollars by assisting Del (Steve Buscemi, \"The Death of Stalin\"), and jockey Bonnie (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, \"Beatriz at Dinner\") doing odd jobs around the track, Charley forms a bond with one of Del's disposable horses, a five-year-old quarter horse named Lean on Pete whose normal position in a horse race is dead last.The worldly-wise Bonnie tells him, however, not to get attached to any horse saying that they are not pets, a truth that Charley realizes when he observes horses at the end of their racing days being shipped to Mexico to discover what a slaughterhouse looks like. Charley's world turns dark when his dad is severely beaten by the husband of one of his girlfriends and he is forced to earn enough money to keep up the household. As Ray's condition worsens, and Lean on Pete is slated to be sent to Mexico, Charley steals the horse in Del's truck in the middle of the night and takes to the road, seeking to find his way to Wyoming to look for Aunt Margy, without knowing anything about her whereabouts.After Del's ancient truck breaks down, cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof J\u00f8nck (\"A War\") keeps us close to the sagebrush and flatlands of Eastern Oregon as the boy and his horse (to whom he confides his innermost thoughts) travel together on foot, coming into contact with both the hard working underclass of American society and the dregs who prey on the innocent and trusting.As Charley moves from town to town, half-starving and disheveled, a child grasping onto any means to stay alive, he is forced into taking revenge on Silver (Steve Zahn, \"Captain Fantastic\"), a homeless man who steals his money in a drunken rage, but it is only one in a series of incidents that test his mettle and define who he is. A feeling of sadness pervades Lean on Pete, yet, like life, it is always filled with the possibility of renewal.Charley's struggle to fit in a world that no longer welcomes him mirrors our own longing to connect, to find someone to care about and care for, to discover, as poet Carl Sandburg put it, \"a voice to speak to us in the day end, a hand to touch us in the dark room, breaking the long loneliness.\" It is Charlie Plummer's beautiful and subtle performance that carries the film and grants us access to our own innermost experience of what it means to feel isolated in a world that we can no longer call our home.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It is mostly a restrained telling as it displays less cynicism than pointing it out as the old gang huddles at the Hyannis Kennedy compound to plot and strategize for what they hope is a future President. Brother from another mother Joe Gargan attempts to get Ted to do the right thing but he is no match for the Realpolitik of Robert McNamara who is clearly running the interference, pulling strings and creating scenarios while local Sheriff Arena bungles his investigation, much of it in the favor of the Senator as a Kennedy flunky is dispatched to the deceased Ms Kopechne's parents to block access. It is a Humpty Dumpty make over and an unpleasant reminder of \"justice\" bought through power and influence in this democratic nation of ours. There's an Oscar worthy performance to be found in tarnished angel's Ted played by Jason Clarke with a smarmy false bravado and unctuous cowardice while garnering great sympathy as he panics and leaves the girl to drown. Clearly the linch pin to the tragedy he is also responsible for some of the dark humor as says too much too soon, fails to re-new his license, comes up with far fetched attempts to elude blame and models a neck brace for effect before tussling on the floor with a fed up Gargan.Kate Mara's Mary Joe rings with a mature and melancholy sincerity, her scenes with Ted tastefully handled, more concerned with revealing two people at uncertain moments in their life than a just a roll in the sand. Helms as Gargan suffers nobly and humiliatingly much by way of reaction. Bruce Dern as paralyzed dad Joe does as well but in a much more severe way while Clancy Brown's former Defense Secretary McNamara is take charge impressive in a room of heavyweights.James Curran's direction is well paced and edited as he smoothly moves the investigation along amid the chaos of what's at stake as well as provide jarring flashbacks and allowing Mary-Jo in her own way provide brutal testimony to the audience. Overall the direction and writing (Taylor Allen, William Logan) is neither venally strident nor smugly damning as the film portrays the tragically flawed Kennedy, justifiably in some way, as a victim for being less than a great man in a circle that would not settle for anything but before once again finding himself out of his depth.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The actors do a superb job. Even Ed Helms and Jim Gaffigan manage to make you forget who they are. Kennedy and his handlers do not come off well, of course. It's a not a documentary and I do not trust Hollywood or the media to portray anyone historical character completely accurately.For me, there are 2 take aways from the movie:1. This was a sincere young lady whose life was cut much too short. It was difficult for me to watch her on screen knowing what was about to happen to her. She deserved better. Sadly, she is a footnote in history. We should refer to it as the Mary Jo Kopechne scandal, not Chappaquidick.2. The end of the film featured \"person on the street\" interviews from 1969. It was amazing to listen to the ones who dismissed his short-comings and continued to support him. Seeing those interviews in the Trump era makes for an interesting perspective. Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton or Donald Trump, the American voter on both sides of the aisle will look past a man's sins if they think that person will advance their political agenda. The opposite is also true: People will mercilessly and unflinchingly condemn a person for his shortcomings if they don't agree politically. This was true during the 2016 election cycle. It was never about Hillary or Trump's demons, it was always politics. Until that is understood, people will never get why Trump has support.The biggest unanswered question for me is: how did Kennedy get out of the car.

The older Justin (Justin Benson) has vivid and terrible memories of their time with the group, but younger Aaron (Aaron Moorhead)has just hazy memories of pleasant times. So, despite Justin's wishes, the two do in fact return to the compound they left a decade earlier. But why are they being summoned back? Are their lives (again) in danger? Or has the cult changed into just being another Northern California commune? When the brothers arrive in the middle of nowhere, they find the de facto leader Hal (Tate Ellington), who explains that the group has prospered in the years since Aaron and Justin left. Their primary source of income? Homemade beer. Very hipster. The members of the small commune/cult each have their own special skill, whether it's painting, knitting, magic tricks. The list is pretty finite, actually.But it isn't too long before things get a little unsettling. No spoilers here; the cult believes there is an all-powerful deity who exists only for them \u2013 i.e., not a God from any other religion. This entity sends the group messages via cassette tapes and Polaroid photos. The group members pass this all off as normal; to be truthful, I found their happiness to be a bit unsettling. But Aaron, the younger/more impressionable of the brothers, wants to believe and is definitely looking for some structure in his life after a decade of menial jobs and no real direction. His wiser brother Justin, is strongly skeptical, but certain events do make him question his own sense of righteousness.So this seems like a pretty straightforward story, doesn't it? Maybe there's something to the cult's thinking, maybe they're really just harmlessly living off the grid. But then a few somethings happen, and the movie switches from being about a crazed cult into being about, well, the neverending loop of reality. And that's when the movie really takes off. I'm talking about mindbending twists and some terrific special effects. Just like that, the plot zooms from just sort of floating about, intriguing but not enticing, and then it blasts into overdrive. And suddenly nothing makes sense, and everything makes sense. It's a huge trip.For that reason, I really enjoyed this movie, the third I saw at this year's Spooky Movie International Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland.

On the surface, it is a taut, well-crafted horror story about a (possible) \"death cult\". We have some mysterious rituals, a missing husband, and seemingly silly camp activities that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 have a darker purpose.Some of this is vaguely alluded to in the opening quote from H. P. Lovecraft, and further still during the lake \"reveal\". The scare quotes here are just because what is revealed at this moment is entirely up to the imaginations of the viewer. A certain Lovecraft story may provide a guide, or it may be merely a coincidence or red herring. But once the big reveal comes, everything goes dark, and the suspense truly becomes horror.The subcutaneous level is focused on a theme: the truth of religion, either this one or religion in general. Though this film really only explores the reality of one (fictional) religion, it does make us wonder: what if some religions we find strange are actually right? With so many religions in the world, it is certainly possible that one or more are correct. And if the strangest ones might be right, we ought to question our own beliefs: do we believe correctly? With so many choices, it is hard to say for sure.Though this deeper meaning may not have been intentional, it nevertheless exists and makes the film even more interesting. The filmmakers previously had a hit with \"Resolution\" (2012), but all signs point to \"The Endless\" being an even bigger success. The film played at Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, and will no doubt be seen by a wider audience throughout 2017.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It wasn't what I intended to see when I traveled to the cinemas last month, but it's what I got. I don't have much to say about the actors, or directors, nor their previous films. I simply walked into this movie blind. It's from this perspective that I'll put together my short review. The Endless is a film about time, life and consequences, coupled with supernatural themes and elements.The Endless starts out poorly and awkwardly with obvious low production value, stale acting and a weirdly present shaky cam. The poor impression this put on me harmed the film in the short term, but actually left a lot of room for it to move upwards, and that it did. The film itself decently improves once the plot moves from the characters normal lives and into the isolated country area where the rest of the movie takes place.The plot itself is the movies strongest suit, but that isn't saying much. It delivers decently on tense moments, interesting characters and creative concepts. Throughout the film I had to remain on my toes to stay on top of some of its more convoluted elements, which I'm going to put into the negative category. I honestly believe a film's plot should at least on a surface level be completely graspable in a first watch, with still plenty of underlying points and themes waiting to be discovered later.By and large the film didn't capture my attention for very long and its even taken me a while to get around to writing this review.

{"imdbId": "tt6772950", "movieTitle": "Truth or Dare", "title": "So Terrible that it's occassionally Funny and Fun", "author": "Jared_Andrews", "postedDate": "14 April 2018", "reviewContent": "You know how some movies can be so bad that they're secretly kind of good? Truth or Dare might be one of those movies.  As far as being legitimately good, it's not. It's terrible. It's littered with nonsensical reactions, silly dialogue, and unintentionally hilarious moments. Maybe those weird smiles that every character makes at one point are scary to others, but I found them funny every time.  The movie is pretty straightforward, but I'll give a brief explanation anyway. A group of friends goes to Mexico on spring break. While there, a stranger invites them to play truth or dare in a creepy abandoned church. It turns out that the game is possessed by a demon who follows them and forces them to continue playing the game until every player is dead. Fail a dare, you die. Tell a lie, you die. Refuse to play, you die.  The game and movie are essentially Jumanji crossed with Final Destination. It's PG-13, so it's not nearly as graphic as Final Destination, which I didn't mind. It all sounds simple enough. But, the filmmakers still changed the rules throughout the movie and also radically changed what we knew about the characters. Maybe these changes were supposed to indicate that the game reveals our true selves and all the previous information was false. But that doesn't totally work because even characters who know nothing about the game change drastically from one scene to the next. This is the sort of thing that makes the movie clearly bad, but also secretly kind of good because you can laugh at the badness. The other part that partially bothered me and partially made me laugh at its absurdity was how emotionally vacant all the characters were. A friend would die, then they just moved on with a shrug. Specifically, when one guy they know (he's kind of a jerk and not exactly a friend) dies a gruesome death, one character watches the cell phone video multiple times. A person snaps his neck, and this character just watches the video with an amused look on his face, like he's watching a dog ride a skateboard. It's messed up. While this character is clearly the worst of the group, none of them are likable. If a movie is going to show a group of people die one at a time, it needs to convince us that we should care about them at least a little bit. Since the characters are unlikable and therefore difficult to sympathize with, I felt apathetic about their deaths (all except one, which I won't spoil). This is another part of the movie that's so bad that it's funny and secretly kind of good.Anyway, I'm dissecting this movie too much. The problems with the movie mostly play as funny while watching. If you want to watch and laugh at a bad scary movie with friends, Truth or Dare is fine. Just make sure you go in with low expectations.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Coop\". Chinese director Chloe Zhao takes a neo-Realist stab at the format with this affecting, strong and experimental film.Unlike Clint Eastwood's unsuccessful recent film where he had the American heroes of the French railway terrorist incident play themselves on screen, Chloe has recruited real-life Native Americans from the South Dakota rodeo milieu to play fictional characters close enough to their real-life personae to establish an immediate and realistic connection. Rodeo has long been a metaphor for Western movie themes, especially those end of an era notions favored by Western masters Sam Peckinpah and John Ford, and here Zhao takes the concept one step further by having these modern day cowboys personified by Native Americans of the Lakota tribe whose culture was effectively destroyed by us \"Americans\", including the cowboys of old.The central protagonist Brady has a face and utterly stoic demeanor the camera loves - a Bronson figure who happens to have the handsome features of a Channing Tatum, but never hitting a false note. His dilemma recalls the Greek myth of Sysiphus, rolling that boulder up the hill only to have it roll back down endlessly, accomplishing nothing. But the difference here is that although he cannot recover from the rodeo accident which renders him unfit to ride anymore (actually, in real-life Brady was injured in a car accident, not from rodeo performance) he is presented as a brilliant horse whisperer, adding great depth and panache to the movie.His best friend Lance, crippled from rodeo, offers the moving sentimentality that Chloe otherwise scrupulously avoids in her filmmaking, using spectacular visual imagery to give the movie a strength that mere documentary technique wouldn't allow. Subsidiary characters like Brady's autistic sister and stern, incapable of expressing his love dad, are potent real-life people rather than Hollywood constructs, though many a character actor would leap at the chance to play these roles. As I watched the movie I thought of many Sports-related pictures that had covered similar ground, perhaps more intellectually and that achieved classic status. Certainly Brando in Kazan's \"On the Waterfront\" as the boxer who \"coulda been a contender\" presents a mirror image to Brady's hero, though their acting styles are diametrically opposed. Kurosawa's \"Dersu Uzala\" is the most brilliant of these movies (but not about sports) of a strong spirit overcoming physical hardship, and I was somewhat surprised that director Zhao chose to make the character's Native American background so subtle in terms of her screenplay, as opposed to Kurosawa in a Russian movie emphasizing the outsider nature of Dersu the Siberian hunter from an ethnic minority. Perhaps it is the lack of a stronger, more universal theme as developed in the Kazan and Kurosawa films that prevents \"The Rider\" from ascending to all-time classic status.

It's a way of telling the audience that Jandreau is, in fact, playing himself, or at least a version of his personality. Brady Jandreau - only his last name is changed for his movie role - is a rodeo rider who is recovering from a near-fatal head injury. Doctors tell him he should never ride again, but after having spent some weeks working in a supermarket, he comes to the conclusion that there's only one thing that makes him happy: riding rodeo's. It's a simple story, but it is told with lots of empathy for the heart wrenching choices Brady has to make. We can see him wrestling with his fate and in the end, he knows that he is meant to ride horses, 'just as a horse is meant to run across the prairie'. There are several side stories deepening the insight in Brady's predicament. His teenage sister is mentally challenged, the family is poor and lives in a trailer, and he has to say goodbye to two of his favorite horses. The film can be interpreted as a heroic tale of perserverence and dedication. Brady lives for the rodeo, and the viewer understands why he gets a kick out of the horses, the clothing, the masculinity and the competition. The director indicates this in subtle scenes. For example when he decides to pawn his custom made saddle, because he needs the money. At the last moment, he changes his mind. But you can also interpret this film a a sad story of a man who has only limited possibilities in life because of the environment he grows up in. Brady really has nothing else in his life, and is not capable of even imagining changing it. One of the saddest scenes in the film is when Brady visits another rodeo hero, who is paralyzed for life after a fall, and lives in a care facility. Helped by three assistants, Brady lifts his friend on a wooden horse, puts a cowboy hat on his head and makes him move as if he is riding a horse. Even this terrible example doesn't deter Brady from continuing rodeo riding. The cinematograpy is beautiful, with plenty of shots showing the treeless prairies of the empty American heartland in all its beauty. It also gives a nice insight into the rodeo world, a cultural phenomenon as essential to the American West as bull fighting is to Spain. But it's essentially a film about a man fighting the odds to do what he wants to do.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Her 2017 effort (which transitioned from the festival circuit to limited releases in several countries in early 2018) is the story of a cowboy who suffered a career-ending rodeo injury and is deciding what to do with the rest of his life. The film stars the title character as himself - and his family as themselves.Brady Jandreau (looking like a young and lean Heath Ledger) plays the titular cowboy. Training and riding horses is what he loves and all he knows. After a devastating fall from a horse, he has a gash on the side of his head, his skin and his skull held together with staples. He struggles through his recovery - and to get used to the idea that he may never ride again. He's not sure whether he can give it up, in spite of the risk to his health and his life. He takes a job in a grocery store, but keeps gravitating back to horses. As he works through his issues, there's no shortage of advice - from those who want him to ride again - and those who know he can't, while caught in the middle is his family - his dad and his mentally challenged sister - and the person he admires most, a fellow rider who is permanently paralyzed.\"The Rider\" is both touching and boring. Although this very personal and realistic story sheds light on the lives of modern cowboys, the whole thing is very slow and uneventful... for most of the film's runtime. However, along the way, something surprising happens. The tedium is gradually replaced by something emotional and relatable. It is then that Movie Fans realize that the time spent getting to know these characters and understanding this way of life has made them invested in the story, which pays dividends before it's over. Of course, the main actors playing themselves (not to mention the people playing the smaller roles) yield some acting that is less than stellar, but everyone and everything in this film feels raw and real, and for those Movie Fans who can make it through the slow parts in this slice-of-life western, they may well feel like they have won the gold buckle themselves. \"B-\"", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Without giving away too much (especially if you're like me and you didn't know much about this 1980s tennis rivalry coming into it), I will say that this is a fabulous film and everyone involved in the making of it should give themselves a huge pat on the back. They have done an incredible job in crafting a story that successfully explores, analyzes and pays homage to two contrasting albeit equally fascinating personalities in sports history.Both of the titular characters are played to perfection thanks to virtuoso performances from Sverrir Gudnason and Shia LaBeouf, the latter of whom was practically made for the role. Regardless of what you think about Shia, his commitment to any role is always awe- inspiring and here he gives a performance that so perfectly combines loud-mouthed arrogance with an icy determination that he actually makes it difficult for you to route against him. He creates a fascinating character alongside the calm, cool and collected persona of Bj\u00f6rn Borg, played exquisitely well by Gudnason. Another performance that deserves a mention is that of Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, whose quiet loyalty really helps to anchor the film in the more pivotal emotional moments.In a lot of ways this film reminded me of \"Rush (2013)\", another excellent film that deftly explored an iconic sports rivalry and how each athlete helped to shape the other. Like Rush, \"Borg McEnroe (2017)\" transcends the sport at hand to become an exploration of human suffering, resilience and, ultimately, redemption. Aside from the themes at hand, the technical brilliance of the film completely grabs your attention and never lets go until the final frame.

{"imdbId": "tt5727282", "movieTitle": "Borg McEnroe", "title": "A match made in heaven, or a double fault?", "author": "Hugh Djwange", "postedDate": "8 October 2017", "reviewContent": "We are currently seeing a vogue for movies about famous sporting rivalries. I think this was kicked off by the excellent Senna (2010), which could have been a fact-of-the-matter biography of Senna but ended up (wisely) focusing on the rivalry between Senna and Prost, which brought an unintended emotional richness to the story. This was followed up by the almost-as-good Rush (2013) which goes back a decade to tell the story of dashing gentlemen racer James Hunt versus the cold, calculating Nikki Lauder. Now, a Swedish-led production effort is telling the story of one of the great tennis matches of all time: four-time champion Bjorn Borg versus the fiery tempered young John McEnroe at the Wimbledon men's final of 1980.As a strange pre-note: I watched Borg vs McEnroe in a completely empty theatre. Clearly, this movie is not getting the attention it deserves. I think it definitely affected my viewing experience; I was able to completely shut off and see it my own way. Which is good, as this film has a real psychological edge.In short, it was an excellent movie. Surprisingly so, in fact. It got to the point where I forgot I was watching a film and really seemed to be inside the heads of the two leads, right there with them, through every match, every up, every down, every argument, every triumph. This is quite the achievement for a film based in historical fact that can't take too many liberties with the story. Within the first couple of scenes, I could tell this was going to be my kind of movie: a real character study. We see a day in the life of global heart-throb mega-star Bjorn Borg, who is beginning to tire of the trappings of fame. I noticed the filmmaking technique of filming Borg in tight, claustrophobic interiors with shadowy men in suits hanging around in the background. It suggests that his life is beyond his control, is being lived for him, and maybe he wants out ... but doesn't know how to do that. All he knows is tennis, and winning.Enter the young and fiery John McEnroe, who is a major blip on Bjorn 'Ice'-Borg's radar. If Borg was the ABBA of tennis, McEnroe was the Sex Pistols. Known for ranting at umpires and crowds, he had whipped London's easily baited tabloid newspapers into a frenzy, they could smell blood in the water, and as McEnroe battled his way into the final with a combination of luck, talent and verve, a fairytale match (and perhaps a major upset) was being set up.Borg is unquestionably the main character of this film. I think we get about a 70:30 time share between the title characters. This is something of a shame, as I thought that McEnroe was perhaps the more interesting character. How does a New York wiseguy from a good family and lots of opportunities end up pushing himself into becoming a tennis world No. 1? The movie never really tries to answer this question. It focuses much more on Bjorg's backstory as a trouble kid who was recruited - some might say brainwashed - into channelling all his anger into his tennis. In perhaps the movie's best scene, McEnroe makes the link between them clear, and spots that Bjorg may seem like an iceberg but really he's a volcano waiting to go off.Shia LeBeouf was an inspired choice to play McEnroe. LeBeouf has always faced fierce criticism of his acting, his suitability for the kind of roles he wins, and has run the tabloid gamut lately with a string of bizarre stories about his life and behaviour. In scenes where McEnroe rants at the press, you feel LeBeouf is really getting something off his chest here. Also excellent is Stellan Skarsgard, who plays a tennis coach with just the right amount of highly questionable morality in pushing youngsters as hard as it takes to produce a champion.My one criticism of the film was the cheesy title cards, which spell out explicitly what's supposed to be happening in the movie with things like \"The rivalry would affect the players for the rest of their lives.\" Show, don't tell, is the first rule of filmmaking. However, the movie's technical excellence - the tennis sequences were utterly spellbinding - and surprising emotional heft and depth make this a wholehearted \"Yes - see it\" recommendation from me.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt5727282", "movieTitle": "Borg McEnroe", "title": "A Tense Sports Drama", "author": "KJ Proulx", "postedDate": "2 November 2017", "reviewContent": "It's without question that sports dramas that are based on true stories usually have a nice emotional core or intensity to them, otherwise what would be the point of making them in the first place. Borg/McEnroe is one of the latest true stories centered around a sport to receive the big screen treatment. Also seeing the return of Shia LaBeouf in a committed role, this movie has a lot going for it that had me excited. Happily, I can say that this is a movie made with care and the overall impact of the film is felt by the time the credits roll. I truly believe that a little bit of everyone out in the world can compare themselves to certain aspects of the two title characters. Although this movie is very small in terms of its theatre count, here's why I believe it deserves your time.As the film leads up to the inevitable Wimbledon finals in the year 1980, Borg/McEnroe follows Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe as it dives into their past and how they may or may not be able to cope with losing the title match in the coming days. This is a very simplistic film that follows these two competitors as they await the match, and then the movie goes out with a bang in keeping you on the edge of your seat as you await the victor. This is also where I found my biggest complaint with the film, seeing as its runtime was a little long for its type of storytelling.Even at a mere 107 minutes, this movie felt a little long, due to the fact that you're really just waiting for the day to come where these two competitors will be going head to head. It felt as though the flashbacks were there to give this film a real feature length feel, but in reality, it ended up feeling like filler. That being said, Borg/McEnroe manages to hold your interest, because each and every one of the flashbacks are interesting (even if it's slightly boring at times). I truly believe that this movie is able to hold everyone's attention because Sverrir Gudnason and Shia LaBeouf give terrific performances here.Being the first time I've seen Sverrir Gudnason on-screen, I can't wait to see more of him, because not only did he look just like Bjorn Borg, but his committed performance really took his character over the edge in my opinion. LaBeouf definitely holds his own as well. Being absent from cinema for the past few years, it was uncertain when his return would be, but I think he will have a perfect fit in independent films such as Borg/McEnroe. His eccentric character got a few laughs and a few tears from the audience and when an actor can accomplish both, he, along with the filmmakers, have done something right.Although not really known for anything mainstream yet, writer Ronnie Sandahl and director Janus Metz definitely have bright futures if they choose to break out even further. The screenplay was very well-written in my opinion, giving just the right amount of levity before getting too serious, and then letting loose throughout the tense tennis sequences as well. I would love to see these two team up again.In the end, Borg/McEnroe is a very, very good film from start to finish. Although simplistic, emotion and tension run rampant throughout. Written and directed with care, acted spectacularly, and delivering a satisfying conclusion even for those who knew the outcome, I really don't have anything negative to say, aside from the fact that it can feel boring at times and a little dragged out to fit a feature film runtime. I recommend checking out Borg/McEnroe when you get the chance. It's a very solid story about two rivals that live very different lives, so to speak.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

A powerful and rigorously disciplined player, there is only one obstacle in his pursuit of a record-breaking fifth Wimbledon championship: the highly talented but ferociously abrasive young American, John McEnroe (a perfectly cast Shia LaBeouf). With three days until the tournament begins, Borg trains religiously in his lavish Monaco home, aided by his coach and mentor Lennart (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) and girlfriend Mariana (Tuva Novotny). But McEnroe's explosive confidence and wrecking-ball persona continue to infiltrate Borg's ice-cool and normally unshakable temperament. With each man the antithesis of the other, both players delve into their formative memories as the climactic tournament draws near and anticipation reaches fever pitch. Visceral and breathlessly tense, the match itself - regarded as one of the greatest of all time - would mark the pinnacle of the 'Fire and Ice' rivalry between Borg and McEnroe; an exhilarating battle of personalities that set the world of tennis alight.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

But unlike those earlier thrillers, which though much beloved by me are somewhat dated by their breathless realization that governments lie and conspire and murder, \"Beirut\" tells its story with a modern sensibility. Yes, CIA was complicit in so much, but individual human beings, even those in CIA, lived and loved and aspired to connect to the people around them -- in this case, the people of Lebanon. Is everyone in the cast Lebanese? I don't know. But I suspect a search through the IMDB cast list will reveal much more authenticity in the casting than the naysayers here complain about. And remember, Beirut was considered the Paris of the Middle East, a cosmopolitan crossroads of cultures. Within the confines of a taut story about the kidnapping of a CIA officer and an outsider's attempt to rescue him while still maintaining some sense of dignity for himself and for the locals he's known for years, the film expertly capture the sadness of a semi-paradise turned hell. Jon Hamm, Rosamund Pike and the rest of the cast are excellent. This is a story about American actions in a foreign land. There's enough blame to go around -- CIA, Mossad, the White House -- all have their competing agendas. That this American film focuses on American CIA and State Dept. characters, and a couple of key Lebanese characters, is hardly a weak point.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt3409848", "movieTitle": "Zama", "title": "Rich, Deep and Dazzling", "author": "Raven-1969", "postedDate": "4 November 2017", "reviewContent": "The radiant colors of fire sparks in the night, shocking pink native dyes and lush green moss, and oscillating cascades of sound including exotic guitar, electronic interludes and soothing lapping waves, these and other rich innovations bring extra zip to the already thrilling story of Don Diego de Zama. Zama, a Spanish administrator in 1700s South America, refuses to adjust to his surroundings and instead pines for the continent and habits he left long ago. As his expected transfer to Spain hangs in limbo, Zama's paranoia about the dangers of the local landscape and hostility towards those of different races, increases. He lives in a bubble of his own creation. Yet if the sulking and morose Zama will not visit the pulsing and vibrant new landscape around him, it will visit him.Director Lucrecia Martel deftly makes the audience part of the story. The scenes she provides are rich and dazzling in a variety of ways; color, sound, wildlife, clothing, furnishings, evident historical research, insight into human nature, brilliant acting and more. Her portrayal is wonderfully balanced. Martel does not glorify the past, nor does she skewer it. Pristine and beautiful scenery of lakes, rivers and forests are offset by glimpses of the morgue with its cholera and plague victims, the cruel and routine punishments and torture implements of the time and whirling ceiling fans that remind you of what the tropics without air conditioning must feel like. Martel's sensitivity and depth of feeling is astounding. The film audience, for example, is not provided with subtitles of native languages. \"We deserve to not understand what the natives are talking about,\" said Martel who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening. \"History taught around the world is mostly about the colonizers.\" In one scene there are three sisters who revolve around a central point in a room, and Martel wants it to seem like they are part of a miniature music box. Such wonderful little touches. The film is spiced with brilliant lines throughout. \"Europe is best remembered by those who were never there,\" for instance, and \"nighttime is safer for the blind.\" The film is based on a novel by Antonio Di Benedetto.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Some of them pop up and disappear just the same. With no explanation whatsover. Then, the campaign to catch the \"thieve\"... it happens out of the blue. I asumed something occurred in between his decision to do so but the director chose (for some unknown reason) not to make that part of the story into the final cut. However, she did decide to include something else. It seems she found a lot of beautiful places to film her movie and in almost everyone she said \"gee, let's film a bit here, no, no actors, just the landscape and then I will include it in the final cut\", well, that is exactly what she did. Perhaps, if you are at home and you get to press fast forward from time to time... it might (huge emphasis there) improve the experience but I most sincerely doubt it.All in all, it's a complete waste of time (and money) and *this* is what we sent from Argentina to the Oscars.

{"imdbId": "tt5886440", "movieTitle": "Marrowbone", "title": "Family is everything.", "author": "S. Soma", "postedDate": "22 February 2018", "reviewContent": "Opening Scenes Preview:MARROWBONE opens with a narrating voice, who we soon discover is the character Jack, describing the arrival of his family at their new home. We are told that they have come a very long way, across an ocean, and that they have endured many difficulties to arrive at what they hope will be a safe haven for them. There are 5 in the family; Jack, the eldest, Billy, Jane, Sam, the youngest who seems to be about five years old, and Rose, their mother. The choice of this home was not an accident; we are told that it was Rose's childhood home and has been standing empty for 30 years.Apparently the family's life to this point has been horrific because Rose draws a line in the dust on the floor and proclaims that once they cross it, their lives will begin anew in all ways and that they will forget their former life altogether. They even change their surname to MARROWBONE.But we are given to know that the past may not allow itself to be forgotten. There are references to a \"he\" and a \"him\" that casts a shadow over the family and their new life, and there is the possibility that \"he\" could become more than a terrifying possibility.But the family settles in to their new home and life soon seems idyllic. Wherever this house is, the shore of the sea is close at hand. Even though they have no close neighbor, they do make a new friend, a young girl named Allie, a very friendly kindred spirit, who immediately seems to become \"one of the family\". The carefree, sunny summer days slide by.Sadly, there is more than one shadow upon the family. Rose has an unnamed disease, and the trip from England has taken her last bit of strength to fight against it. As she lies upon her death bed, and in private, she gives Jack her last instructions and important points on how to care for the family in her absence. Rose is to be buried in the garden at a place she has already specified. Jack must do his best to keep the family secret and hidden until he turns 21 or they will be split apart. Have a safe place in case \"he\" finds them. Lastly, there is a tin container holding a large sum of money that Rose took from the shadowy \"he\". Jack is shocked at this last item because Rose apparently lied in court to keep it. But before he can object he sees that Rose, his mother, is gone. The last of her instructions Jack reads aloud to the family from a note left with the tin of money.The four children proclaim an oath of unbreakable family bonds literally over the body of their mother, swearing that \"nothing and no one\" will ever be permitted to tear the family apart.But as luck would have it, not long after Rose's death, the terrifying \"he\" becomes far more substantial. He announces his presence by firing a shot through a window next to Jane from all the way across a meadow. In stark terror, Jane shrieks for Jack.But in the very next scene, which we are told is 6 months later, everything seems to be fine, surprisingly. Aside from an annoying legal representative whose pointy-headed inquisitiveness perpetually threatens to \"out\" the hiding family, things seem to be going surprisingly well.Although...There is now talk of a ghost in the house. The mirrors are all covered. There is something that menaces from above the ceiling...Review:Very surprising to me is the fact that this is a Spanish-made movie through and through. It's filming locations were Terrassa, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, and all of the credits and any subtitles are entirely in Spanish. For example, \"six months later\" appears on the screen as \"seis meses m\u00e1s tarde\". And yet the entire context of the movie is mid to late sixties America, all the dialogue is entirely in English, and absolutely no dubbing has taken place. As far as I can tell, the depicted Americana is pretty much flawless. First time I've ever seen something like this.While others have complained of the lack of originality in MARROWBONE, as I have mentioned in other reviews, this is never a problem for me. Considering how many thousands of supernatural/horror pictures have been made by now, it's my position that it's utterly unreasonable to expect true novelty/originality of a horror picture at this point. There are very few completely novel roller coasters or firework shows in my experience, and yet I still like to ride them/see them. A well-done horror picture is a thing of beauty even if it can't be completely new. And to those who incessantly prattle about \"originality\", if you insist upon limiting your sense of pleasure to only new experiences, do make a point of never getting married. You will be sharply disappointed.So, no, you will see nothing entirely original in MARROWBONE, but the execution of these tropes was so well done that I didn't catch on until late in the game. Additionally, there are many plot points that specifically support some of the more difficult-to-believe story elements, in contrast to the many horror pictures whose plot lines collide with their tropes, leaving large holes. When you find yourself disbelieving the lengths to which Jack will go to keep the family \"together\", one way or another, think back to the admonitions of Rose on her deathbed and the solemn swearing ceremony over her dead body. Jack truly was obsessed with keeping the family together. In whatever way he could...Early on in the picture I remember thinking that the character Allie, while not exactly beautiful, most certainly has a face and personality that would be virtually impossible not to love. The fact that the very, very ending of the movie is incredibly sweet and utterly unrealistic is entirely in keeping with that thought. Exceptionally charming, I also thought sadly, \"Well, THAT would never happen.\"If utter originality is NOT your reason for living and you are able to enjoy a delicious dish more than once, you should give MORROWBONE a watch. It's exceptionally well done and has a heart wrenching, bittersweet ending.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

To keep this review spoiler free, I cannot delve too deep into the plot or development of the characters, which sadly makes it hard to describe this film, as it truly is one of those unique films that completely surprises you, just when you think you have a grip on what's going on. To give you an idea, after watching this movie, the film [\"Split\"2017] came to mind. If you found that movie intriguing or in any way exciting to watch, this film will definitely have you asking for more. If you're not into horrors and the trailer gave you the idea that this is some sort of \"scary\" movie with spirits and demons cursed upon a family, it really isn't. In fact, there is no ghosts or mythical beings in this film, it's just a pure chair-gripping horror/adventure movie with great storytelling and immensely superb acting.That brings me to my final summary of why you should watch this film. If you're purely into acting, the fine art of performing well behind camera, you will definitely admire this film as a pure masterpiece. All the actors were extremely impressive at their role, each portraying emotion and understanding of their character at such depth. That being said, George MacKay, playing the role of \"Jack\", were definitely on a level of his own and in my opinion, deserved a best actor nomination. He truly brought his character alive with his complete understanding of the raw emotions that had be precisely portrayed. It is sad to see how such a great film with admirable storytelling and top class acting can be so greatly underrated.

In fact, it's almost too slow at the beginning, and deceptively so, since once the real story begins to be told, it picks up speed and never stops moving. You'll also guess the twist early on, then you'll have to guess again, and then guess again, but guessing and being wrong a couple of times is a lot better than guessing and being right the first time.

Ostensibly she lives in Brooklyn, but her real location, for the purposes of this low-lit, depressing mise en scene, is the interior darkness of a middle-aged, jobless, depressed woman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Aided by Oscar-nominated Bradford Young's shadowy cinematography, director Andrew Dosunmu crafts a near perfect outward evocation of the spiritual loneliness of a woman who has recently lost her mother.As her life spirals downward spiritually and financially, Kyra finds some solace in the arms of neighbor Doug (Kiefer Sutherland), a part-time job slacker, who tries as much as he can to comfort her even though he is marginalized by the film's lighting and proxemics. Kyra is desperately alone in a city that forgets about the aging, like the recurring motif of the elderly lady with the cane.A light larceny is forcing itself on Kyra, and who can blame her? Her credit cards have maxed out, and the job interviews have led nowhere. Although this is not a real thriller, enough of the noirish urban danger bleeds through to confirm the despair so many down and outers must feel in that unforgiving world on NYC and its burbs.Pfeiffer should be recognized for her remarkably restrained and deeply-felt role. Unfortunately, writer Darci Picoult has little dialogue for her, and the lighting is the most powerful vehicle for the despair of urban loneliness and poverty, poverty porn if you will.

When man interferes with nature, it always goes wrong, you think people would learn but why do they have to when Dwayne Johnson is there to save the day!!! Inspired by a video game I'm not familiar with, Rampage is as corny as they come, yet with monsters as gargantuan to the species as Dwayne Johnson is to his, this film somehow works. A science experiment, in the eyes of many, has gone wrong, but in the greedy money grabbing eyes of the people who are in control of the scientists, everything is right on track to make their fortune. Throw the military into the mix and you have a typical Hollywood all action disaster film. Once again Chicago bears the brunt, and it's such visual feast of varying shaped buildings, interspersed with bridges, waterways, a raised railway transit system and a huge lake next to it, it must be a movie makers delight to base it as the battlefield of all manner of horror/disaster/saving humanity stories, and I for one love seeing it used as a set for such film genres.

{"imdbId": "tt6791096", "movieTitle": "I Feel Pretty", "title": "I Feel Pretty... even though it doesn't really show", "author": "Davor Blazevic", "postedDate": "22 April 2018", "reviewContent": "\"I Feel Pretty\" (2018) may not be the greatest movie, but it's not a bad one either, at least not as bad as its current IMDb rating, 3.4 out of 10, shows. What's puzzling (well, only slightly, given the video-gaming world we live in) is that movies having stories and subjects very little to do with reality: space operas, movies about superheroes... practically by default get higher rating, at least 7 out of 10, while not-at-all bad movies, but, in comparison to former, slightly unattractive since so unexcitingly set in real life, get often an average, or, as in this case, a very low rating. So, which of the two is more important quality of the movies (today), having the story told well nested in reality, or their technical superiority?Answers will offer opposing views, but numbers show that great majority of viewers appreciate later. I have also enjoyed spectacular show while watching the ginormous gorilla George (Saint George) killing the augmented alligator (slaying the dragon), in latest IMAX theatres' favourite \"Rampage\" (2018), but what's the point? There's no point, because point is supposed to make sense, and there's a little sense outside of reality. On contrary, as unimpressive as it is, \"I Feel Pretty\" is so real, and as such, more relevant in everyday life. Appealing factor in \"I Feel Pretty\" is the fact that movie managed to remain realistic in giving a believable reason (a head injury accident in a gym) for the main vehicle moving the story forward, i.e. for the changed perception of herself the main character goes through, therefore gaining confidence and modifying the way she carries herself. Regular movie goer with longer viewing experience will easily recall how numerous other, pretty good movies from the past managed to be quite entertaining, but only after fantastic premise has been served. Time-traveling movies, well represented by \"Back to the Future\" trilogy (1985, 1986, 1990) with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, long list of body-swapping fantasies like \"Freaky Friday\" (1976) with Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster (or Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan in its 2003 remake) as mother and daughter whose personalities switch their bodies, Bill Murray's character repeatedly reliving the same day in \"Groundhog Day\" (1993), Michael Keaton's character quadrupled by cloning in \"Multiplicity\"... to name a few. So, once we accept the fantastic premise, those movies are even more entertaining than the one reviewed here, at least leaving to \"I Feel Pretty\" advantage of having no fantasy infusion required, thus deserving the coveted attribute of being realistic.Thanks to already veteran writers/first time directors, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, for coming up with a realistic reason (even though already seen before) for vital twist that propels the story. Though quite repeatedly, Ms. Amy Schumer successfully gets the (known) message (on getting the inner splendor loose) across, and, while doing so, achieves fluent and humoristic narrative, making it easy to accept her character, Renee Bennett, suddenly not limited only to her inner beauty, a point surely aided by the fact that actress herself doesn't even fall in to the only other category... less beautiful... long ago advised as applicable for women.Contrasting the dominant, loud female lead with her quiet, not shy (to deliver the line \"Can I be you when I grow up?\") but rather laid back, eventually boyfriend Ethan (Rory Scovel) was helpful, Other contributive \"witnesses\" include friends Vivian and Jane (Aidy Bryant and Busy Philipps), and quietly hysterical office mate Mason (Aidan Martinez). Finally, in her supporting role as Avery LeClair, heiress to cosmetic line, although for her corporate position apparently sufficiently highly educated and quite well looking, Michelle Williams feels unsecure and requires help, so she uses suddenly wonderfully uninhibited Renee to deal with her physical (vocal) limitations, lack of business ideas, and other frustrations of her somewhat awkward position. Already established as dramatic actress, Williams uses this chance well to skillfully break into comedic acting by spicing her character with a touch of restrained lunacy. In conclusion, film is at times touching, sufficiently amusing, and positively motivating... all of which should, hopefully, help (not only) girls \"feel pretty and witty and bright!\" (Line excerpted from the musical \"West Side Story\" and its song of the same title \"I Feel Pretty\".)", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The arrival of a mysterious package one day from a famous TV psychic investigator from Goodman's own childhood era, Charles Cameron (Leonard Byrne) - a man thought to be long dead and whose own disappearance years before had been shrouded in mystery - soon changes the course of Goodman's future work, dramatically.It transpires that there are three ghostly mysteries that Cameron himself had wrestled with throughout his life, yet they remain unresolved to this day. It is Cameron's wish, in his old age, that Goodman should now investigate them and bring some much needed resolution to proceedings.Armed with each of the case files, Goodman sets about tracking down the three key proponents, upon whose testimony these apparent other-worldly happenings are based.Though somewhat shaken by his findings, Goodman's own innate scepticism leads him to believe that each of these cases can easily be explained away through the simple application of science and logic.But sometimes it's the psychological uncertainties of our own minds that can provide the biggest clues when we seek to make sense of the seemingly inexplicable.Dyson and Nyman's Ghost Stories works effectively for much of its duration as an apparently straight forward, slightly hammed-up spook-fest, though there is little by way of conclusions that can be garnered on face value from any of the three tales.But alarm bells should begin to ring for the viewer when one considers that the first two tales are told from the perspective of a couple of characters who, despite ultimately finding themselves cornered by forces of evil and in apparently terminally hopeless predicaments, both still somehow manage to live to tell the tale. And it's only once the third tale reaches it's climactic 'conclusion' that events really start to take a peculiar twist, and Ghost Stories slips into an even more intriguing dimension altogether; one whose narrative slips and slides between apparently random events of varied illogic, yet one which ultimately helps to tie the film's pieces neatly and cleverly together.There are a few passing parallels with landmark horror films of yesteryear. Elements of Poltergeist and The Blair Witch Project are apparent in places, but curiously it's a sort of tongue-in-cheek, 'hammer house' atmosphere that is most prevalent here. And although admittedly bearing little resemblance, content-wise, Roy Ward Baker's 1981 ghoulish and very British, twist-in-the-tale offering, The Monster Club, with its own lightly comical regaling of three haunting tales - is for me, somehow the film that I am most reminded of.Certainly, within their own film, Dyson and Nyman are unafraid to administer generous doses of gallows humour in just the right places, and the casting of two chiefly comic actors in Martin Freeman and Paul Whitehouse - both of whom are excellent here - in two of the film's key roles, certainly helps with regard to this, whilst Nyman's own rather more straight portrayal of a man with an emotionally-scarred past, is equally impressive.Whether it's to be considered a mysterious cognitive thriller or simply a ghostly shocker, either way, Ghost Stories is highly effective, lingering on in the memory the way all good cerebrally-challenging psychological horrors should.For all of my reviews, visit my: WaywardWolfBlog Wordpress site.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

In 1971, William Friedkin directed one of my all-time favorite films, THE FRENCH CONNECTION. He won the Oscar for Best Director. But of course that's not the movie which entrenched him as a cinematic legend. Two years later he directed THE EXORCIST, a film that, 45 years later, still regularly appears at or near the top of most \"Best Horror film\" lists. For most of his adult life (he's now in his 80's), Mr. Friedkin has been associated with exorcisms, and he kicks off this documentary by confessing that he will be attending his first ever actual exorcism ... and will be filming the ceremony. It's a ritual very few of us have ever witnessed, and we learn that more than 500,000 Italians seek exorcisms from a priest each year. The director seems very anxious to take us along on his journey.We get interviews and footage from multiple associated folks: Jeffrey Burton Russell, author of \"The Prince of Darkness\" and other satanic novels; William Peter Blatty, author of \"The Exorcist\"; a young Los Angeles priest who simultaneously expresses skepticism while stating he wouldn't want to get that close to the devil; and a couple of Neurosurgeons and some Psychiatrists. There are also interviews with a brother and sister recalling her experience of having a liberating exorcism performed on her, and the titular Father Gabriele Amorth - one of the most beloved figures in the Catholic Church. He was Head Exorcist for the Diocese of Rome for more than 30 years.Whether the movie works for you or not (whether you believe it's real) likely depends on the interview we neither see nor hear. Mr. Friedkin's build up is to the exorcism he attends as Father Amorth performs the 9th exorcism on 'Cristina'. It's May 1, 2016 and there are perhaps 12-15 people in the room, including Cristina's parents and boyfriend. She has struggled with \"demonic possession\" for years, and the footage is quite startling - especially the audio of the guttural voice from such an innocent looking lady. It's also Father Amorth's 91st birthday and he literally thumbs his nose at the devil. It's after this ceremony where Friedkin claims he was to interview Cristina in a local church. Inexplicably, he doesn't have his camera, so we only hear him tell of the horrific events.Mr. Friedkin directs the film (co-written with noted film critic Mark Kermode) and also acts as our guide through the rituals and beliefs associated with exorcisms. There is a bit of a \"Dateline\" vibe to the production, though it's a bit surreal to hear Father Amorth proclaim to the evil spirits, \"You are banned forever\". As has been the tradition for years, religion and science are at odds with the subject. Neurosurgeons label it \"delirium\", while Psychiatrists call it \"Disassociate Trance Disorder\". Is it merely a placebo effect caused by religious beliefs, or does Satan exist? Perhaps author Jeffrey Burton Russell says it best: \"stay away from this stuff\".", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I personally don't think it's his best film but there's no question that it was a ground-breaking motion picture that was the director's most successful at the box office. It's interesting to see that towards the end of his career he would revisit the subject of exorcisms but this time it's the true story of Father Amorth who let Friedkin film his ninth exorcism on a woman.THE DEVIL AND FATHER AMORTH got released to mostly negative reviews with many calling into question the ethics of Friedkin because of a twist that happens towards the end of the picture. I'll get to that more in a minute but there's no doubt that this here is a rather questionable movie for the director to tackle and especially when you consider it's just 69-minutes, which makes it feel more like a Blu-ray extra instead of an actual feature. In fact, Friedkin hasn't taken too kindly to the negative press this film has gotten and has really lashed out at critics.Well, I'm sorry to say it but I have to agree with the negativity surrounding this picture. The first ten or so minutes basically has Friedkin talking about THE EXORCIST including revisiting the locations where it was filmed. He talks about the case that the movie was based on and then we get some archival footage of William Peter Blatty discussing the original case and the film. Umm... okay. I'm really not sure why we needed this stuff unless it was some sort of attempt to bring more attention to this movie. Perhaps the running time wasn't long enough so this was added?Whatever the case is, none of this early footage is of much interest but then we jump to the exorcism that is being performed. We hear from the woman's family as well as Father Amorth who talks about exorcisms and various ones that he has performed. Once we get to the exorcism the main thing that's going to jump out is the voice coming from the woman. Some have question whether it's a sound effect or not but I really don't know. Are these scenes scary? Not at all.What follows is Friedkin talking to a various of doctors and showing them the footage. There's a debate on whether it is some sort of brain issue yet we never really get any test results from the woman herself. The back and forth debate on the religious issue to the medical one is rather interesting but then we get back to the controversial ending. I'm not going to spoil it for people but I must admit that I found it to be incredibly stupid and I didn't buy it at all. It's like one of those monster hunter television shows where nothing ever happens until the moment a camera isn't set up.THE DEVIL AND FATHER AMORTH is a film that I was really looking forward to but it's a real shame that it turned out the way it did.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The French title refers to a formidable opponent which seems very appropriate considering who this story is about. image2.jpeg This films comes here with high expectations because the subject of the film is Jean-Luc Godard, arguably the most famous and surely the most controversial French film director of the XX. century and until now nobody has ventured or dared to make a biopic about the cantankerous 86 year old cin\u00e9aste. Michel Havanacius, director of the 2011 Oscar winning film The Artist has now taken that step and cast popular fast rising actor Louis Garrel as his Godard. The picture focuses on the making of La Chinoise in 1967 which was a major turning point in Godard's career and featured young actress Anne Wiazemsky whom Godard married after the making of that film. He was then 36 and she was nineteen. It was a stormy marriage following his first marriage to another of his stars, Anna Karina, and only lasted two years when Godard was at the peak of his fame and also the acme of his unbridled arrogance ...which is emphatically presented throughout. The film is basically a study of the collapse of that marriage and Godard's embracing of Maoist revolutionary politics which completely altered his career trajectory and sharply divided his fan base while destroying his marriage as well. Hazanavicius most successfully captures the atmosphere of the time and the year that this Cannes film festival was closed down by Godard and other New Wavers as a protest against the oppression of the government of Degaulle. He also captures the purposeful naughtiness of Godard films by throwing in female and female frontal nudity arbitrarily, clearly meant as a sly comment rather than a titillation. Other Godardian devices such as obscene graffiti and inter-titles and jump cuts add to the nouvelle vague flavor. Wiazemsky is effectively played played by actress Stacy Martin who was featured alongside Charlotte Gainsbourg in Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac a few years back. Louis Garrel was a good choice to impersonate Godard and turns in a commendable job even if it is more of an impersonation than entering the skin of his subject -- which, considering the type of slippery personality Godard actually is, would be an almost impossible job.This is overall a rather light and breezy treatment of what could have been a very knotty and heavy handed film in less skillful hands. Hazanavicius has the right touch for this touchy subject Jean-Luc himself has called the film \"a stupid, stupid, idea\" -- one would hardly expect him to call any film about himself anything else. For Nouvelle Vague and Godard buffs this film is essential \"reading\".", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

If Hollywood loves making films about Hollywood, why should not make the French also films about the French cinema? Especially if we are talking about a director (Michel Hazanavicius) who already made a very successful film about Hollywood (\"The Artist\"). Here is his daring approach to a genre which is surprisingly new for the French cinema - movies about movies. \"Redoubtable\" is a daring endeavor because the subject is one year in the life of one of the most controversial film directors in the history - Jean-Luc Godard., a complex artist and personality who is also still with us, making films and even commenting on films made about him.The year is also not any other year, but 1968, one of the milestones in the history of the 20th century, a crossroad also in the history of France. The revolts of the students that peaked in May of that year had several sources of inspiration - anarchist and Maoist ideloogies among them, but also works of philosophers like Jean Paul Sartre and, yes, movies, among which Jean-Luc Godard's \"La Chinoise\". The French director had gained fame in the decade before with some of the best known films of the French 'Nouvelle Vague'. Some had ideological content, some other 'just' revolutionized (together with films by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and a few other) the language of cinema. \"La Chinoise\" had marked the final of that period and the start of another, a much more politically oriented stage in his creation. It also marked the beginning of the relationship soon to turn into marriage with Anne Wiazemsky. (the second for Godard, after he had married and divorced Anna Karina). The implication of Godard in politics and the rocky marriage with Anne are the principal topics of \"Redoubtable\". The Godard in the film does not come very clean from this historical re-evaluation on screen which is based on the novel-memoirs of his ex-wife. He appears as a 'gauchist' intellectual who sides with the revolt and hates police, but his behavior and way of life belong to the class he despises. His ideology seems more anarchist and quite remote from realities. He fails to understand the totalitarian ways of his idols Mao and Che and is stupefied when \"La Chinoise\" is rejected by the Chinese embassy as 'reactionary art' and he is refused a promotion trip to China. His joining of the May 1968 revolts leads to confusing speeches in the meeting halls at Sorbonne, including an outrageous rant paralleling Jews and Nazis. He is, as many other before him, a victim of a revolution in march that devours its idols. Eventually he makes the right choice understanding that an artist can better serve the revolution by means of art, and for a while he looks better holding a camera on the streets of Paris in 1968, or founding the Djiga Vertov collective of politically active filmmakers. This may lead to another impasse, an artistic one, but that will not be part of the story in this film.I liked the film. Michel Hazanavicius uses a technique that he already successfully applied in \"The Artist\" - talking about a past period in the history of the cinema with the cinematographic tools specific to that era. He even added more nuances, as different episodes are filmed in different styles adapted to the content. We see the scenes with Paris on barricades filmed with 'Nouvelle Vague' hand-held camera. A trip by car in which a crowded mix of film-makers and actors get a speech from their driver about the simple taste in cinema of the masses, so remote from their experiences, is filmed in a static car, like in an American movie of the 30s or 40s. At the peak of the domestic crisis the unbearable soundtrack covers the voices of the disputing lovers. Louis Garrel created a Godard who oscillates between his (well deserved) ego and surprising moments of lack of confidence, who thinks in an ideological and doctrinaire manner but knows little about the people the ideology is supposed to serve, who models his life and art to politics and has little understanding or patience for his own adulating audiences. The relationship with Anne (Stacy Martin) is almost permanently one-directional, a crisis in building from the very first moments. Both actors do fine jobs, and they are placed in an environment that brings brilliantly to life the period for those spectators who lived it as well as for those who did not.Focusing on politics and the stormy marriage between Jean-Luc and Anne, \"Redoubtable\" tells less about the cinema that he made - and 1968 was actually a very prolific year, as were the coming 3 or 4 years, although much of what he did was documentary of collective work within the Djiga Vertov group. The one scene that show him at work is filmed one year later, and hints to the fact that, at least for the coming period that was to last about another decade, Godard made a choice. Between art and revolution, he explicitly chose revolution. The final judgment about this period may have not been pronounced, and this film could be part of a re-opening of the discussions and more important - seeing again his films. Godard is Godard, and he never seems to accept to rest.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

In my opinion, he was not able to capture the \"Godard mood\" at all. Instead, the film is executed in a textbook manner, meticulously using Godard's cinematic language like a receipt and that's always a risky move (for example, Gus Van Sant's case with Psycho). Godard is Godard not for using these elements, but because he used them at the right time and in the right way. If this would have been done by breaking new grounds in cinematic language, or even without breaking the mould in such a way BUT finding the right tone, I would have liked the film much more. Godard's world has a sexy, humorous yet tragic atmosphere, where the viewer feels for the characters. To be honest, when watching a Godard movie, I'm always terribly envious that I was not born at the time of Belmondo. Here, I did not feel this longing, sadly. Having said that, the actors are cute and the director seems to be cool and all, judging from interviews, so it may be that I'm just too sentimental. :)", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

{"imdbId": "tt5687334", "movieTitle": "Godard Mon Amour", "title": "A fascinating insight into the mind of one of the most important French directors of all time", "author": "Kapten Video", "postedDate": "28 December 2017", "reviewContent": "Movies about real historical events and persons from everyday perspective are cool.This one's about the legendary French director Jean-Luc Godard (played by Louis Garrel) reaching middle-age and marrying a young girl (Stacy Martin). It turns out Goddard, idolized by movie lovers and critcs, turns out to be the immature one in the relationship.Like any good movie about relationships should, \"Le redoutable\" has both moments of laughter and soul wrenching drama. But above all, this is a character portrait of a increasingly domineering and unpleasant man.Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius approaches the study of the character from the deep psychological standpoint. He does not offer some easy and populist way of explaining the reasons behind tormented genius's growing disagreeableness over time.Just like in real life, there's no one single cause for how one behaves, especially not something external that would be easy to blame and would adequately summarize everything that's going on in human soul (bad influence, broken heart etc).If the viewer is not willing or able to go that deep, there's still enough going on to justify the time spent. The movie is humorous - especially in the first half - and offers a vivid overview about how destructive immature people can become in loving relationship if they wrestle with power and intimacy issues.In Godard's character, I found much of myself and what I've had to wrestle with in relationships - and still have to. So watching it was a bit depressing for me, for probably nobody enjoys seeing one's ow faults so clearly from aside (in others).The second half turns increasingly darker in mood and get exhausting because there's basically only one situation filling the story which gets repeated over and over again. The lack of variety is the reason of me hesitating to give it higher score than 7 out of 10.The story centers mostly on Godard and young wife, Anne Wiazemsky, and their performances are really good. These are demanding roles because the marital discord doesn't grow from one explosive conflict to another but accumulating stress and tension between two people, expressed mostly in subtle bodily or facial impressions that the camera eagerly catches.This kind of inner burning based suspense is surely difficult to build on screen, and both stars are really good at it (with the help of the director, of course).I enjoyed Stacy Martin's performance especially, for in a way, she has fewer resources to build the character than Garrel whose Godard does most of the talking.Martin gives a beautifully restrained but emotive performance as the ever-suffering wife. She's the emotional backbone of the story and probably the one thing you'll remember the best from the movie.Based on the memoir of Anne Wiazemsky, who became a novelist and published the book on her life with French cinema genius in 2015. Godard lives on, but she passed away just weeks ago, October 5th this year, succumbing to battle with breast cancer at the age of 70.Michel Hazanavicius is best known for \"The Artist\" that got nominated for ten Oscars, and won five, in 2012, including for the best movie and director.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.\nWith The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.\nBelieve the hype, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.\n5 stars out of 5", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
{"imdbId": "tt4154756", "movieTitle": "Avengers: Infinity War", "title": "This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be.", "author": "shawneofthedead", "postedDate": "25 April 2018", "reviewContent": "Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity Wars is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, \"We don't trade lives\", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero m\u00eal\u00e9e that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. \nSo let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). \nNow, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. \nAnd of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. \nI cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10.

It pains me to say this because this had the potential to be very good. \"Kings\" is a story centered around the LA riots which occurred in the early 90's. It's told through the perspective of a family who find themselves in the middle of the intense event. There was set-up for great drama, but the end result is an uneven mess with little to no pay-off. This movie had the most abrupt and out of nowhere endings that I've seen all year. Early on we seem to be promised an emotional and riveting finale. And we never get that finale. It just sort of ends before the third act is taking shape. The first half of the film suffers a lot. I didn't form much of an attachment with the characters. The editing switches too quickly between people with little moments to breath and for you to get to know them. Besides, almost every scene during the first half consists of people yelling and talking over each other constantly. The pace is unfocused. You can only take so much loud shouting before your only wish is for people to calm down and be quiet for just a second. The silent or calmer scenes are precious because there are so few of them. Halle Berry gives a good performance and so does Daniel Craig. They are both like-able as their bonding slowly progresses throughout the story. If they only picked a better project to be apart of though. It was a waste of their talents. Lamar Johnson who plays Berry's son gets a lot screen-time, and he was really good playing a grounded and sympathetic character. There's much heavy lifting for him to do as he wants to make sense out of the situation and find some peaceful solution to many problems. I was on-board with his story-line until he, of course, disappears towards the end. The development of the character pretty much stopped just as it was about to get the most interesting. Tonally it's all pretty realistic with documentary like montage sequences. Well, except for one abstract dream scene involving Berry and Craig that confused half the audience. It was supposed to be \"romantic\", but it's like nothing else in the entire movie. The scene comes off as more comedic than anything because of how cheesy the presentation is. It was kind of embarrassing as well, which made me feel bad for the actors.The actual riot scenes weren't bad. It's the journey up to that point that's difficult to tolerate. If only they didn't let every dialogue scene be people yelling, shouting or screaming. The pulse can't be that high all the time. There needs to be some breathing. I like the actors and the director is respected, but they can't save the movie. We get some sprinkled decent moments, but there's just not enough of them. Oh, I'll give it a point for being shot on film. No complaints on cinematography. Don't rush out to see this one once it comes out. Catch it on VOD or something and be sure to not have the volume too high. Trust me, it's gonna get loud. My other summary of the film is: I like you guys, but better luck next time.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Although the title is never really explained, the film is about a family of foster kids in South Central Los Angeles who struggle to deal with endemic racial discrimination - and to survive the L.A. riots following the 1992 Rodney King beating trial verdict.Oscar winner Halle Berry stars as Millie Dunbar, a foster mother who loves children and has a special place in her heart for troubled kids. She has a house full of them - boys and girls of different races and ages. She loves all of them as if they were her own and she works multiple jobs to take care of them. That last part means she's often away from home, and care for the younger ones often falls to her oldest, Jesse (Lamar Johnson). Jesse is intelligent and responsible, but he struggles against the instincts of his short-tempered best friend, William (Kaalan \"KR\" Walker), and a short-tempered neighbor, named Obie (Daniel Craig), who complains about Millie's parenting - and the noise coming from her house.The film uses a re-enactment of the fatal March 16, 1991 shooting of teenager Latasha Harlins by an L.A. Korean convenience store owner and news of the shooter's conviction, but subsequent sentence of probation, to set the stage for the events to come. As frustration in the black community builds, the film's plot remains focused on Millie's make-shift family and their relationships with their friends and other members of their neighborhood, including Obie. When it is announced that the police officers who beat Rodney King on the night of March 3, 1991 have been acquitted, rioting begins. Millie's kids are involved in the mayhem in various ways and she fights to find and protect them, with Obie helping her.\"Kings\" is a personal window into the lives of average people during one of the most upsetting and violent moments in recent American history. Although fictionalized, the story is nevertheless affecting and the film is dedicated to one of the young men who lost his life during the riots. Some of the plot points feel contrived, but the film's effective at delivering greater understanding of and compassion for those affected by the L.A. riots - and the issues that led up to that episode - some of which clearly continue to plague society today. \"B+\"", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

In the world of tinder, it's all 1s and 0s, but real life these days is much less binary and less immediately satisfying. You won't find that kind of easy romcom satisfaction in Denis' film. One is buffeted by indecision, imprecision, and inaction while swimming in self doubt and self loathing. Isabelle, our stand-in for the duration, is emotionally exhausting. She asks a lot of her lovers and of the audience. She says \"stay with me, stay,\" and Denis uses Juliette Binoche to maximum seductive affect but it's not an easy journey. Isabelle is, by turns, a strong woman with a lot to offer and who knows what she wants, but also a weak human being filled with doubt. She's a paradox and a contradiction, but she also understands without acknowledging that she will always have opportunities...another opportunity. She is someone who is exploring the boundaries of her self. It's perplexing territory to the men she meets but also to herself. Denis shows us as many facets of Isabelle as we are willing to see, that we can see. I think there's a lot more there than I could see at one sitting. A unique portrait.

{"imdbId": "tt6423776", "movieTitle": "Let the Sun Shine In", "title": "Meh I found it very underwhelming for the most part", "author": "Horst in Translation (filmreviews@web.de)", "postedDate": "23 December 2017", "reviewContent": "\"Un beau soleil int\u00e9rieur\" or \"Let the Sun Shine In\" or \"Bright Sunshine In\" or \"Dark Glasses\" is a French/Belgian co-production in the French language released this year in 2017 and it is the newest work by experienced writer and director Claire Denis. The film runs for slightly over 90 minutes and this also includes closing credits as they interestingly enough were displayed already during the final scene. But we will get to that later. The heart and soul of the film is French Oscar-winning actress Jukliette Binoche, in her 50s now already, but still pretty stunning. The entire film is basically about encounters she has with men, most of them sexual, except the one guy talking to her at the fish shop, the needy one. But everybody else she somehow ends up in bed with while according to the movie she is looking for real true love. But she is definitely also a bit on the promiscuous side and the ways in which we see how desperate she really is are perhaps not enough to hide that, like the crying scenes or the way in which she talks to the Black fella near the end. But maybe my problem with this movie is also how very unlikable all the protagonists are really. Maybe they are just flawed like everybody else, but is that really justification enough? The one hitting rock-bottom is definitely the married guy we see during this long bar scene, perhaps the least likable film character from 2017. We also see him in the very first scene of the film, a sex scene with Binoche's breasts visible and you could think that she lays her innermost out there and it could have been a good start for a great movie. Too bad it is never a great film. Binoche still looks really good for her age and this may be the only amazing component.Now I want to say a couple words in detail about the final scene. First of all, the credits did not really take anything away from it for me. The only result is that you obviously won't check for the names, but then again you don't otherwise either do you? Finally having Depardieu and Binoche hand it to each other eventually could have been one of the finest film scenes of the year, but it really is no such thing. It is all about Depardieu here, never about Binoche as she is basically just listening. As we don't see Depardieu before except in this very short random car scene, I was quite surprised about his inclusion. It felt very random and the scene is really all about the actor, never about the characters. Such a shame as I like Depardieu and Binoche really a lot and I so so wanted this to be better. Back to the entire film, there were some audience members who laughed a great deal from start to finish in my viewing, but I personally must say the comedy component here was minimal to me. It felt way more about the relationship drama and the protagonists longing for and lack of romantic happiness in her life. Still quotes and reactions felt extremely unauthentic on many occasions, which is why I must say that the characters' actions and reactions made no sense on more than just a few occasions. And this is a negative deal breaker in my opinion. I would not say that the performers were bad or anything, actually they elevated the material at times even, but they can only be as good as the script they are given. And what they were given here was most of the time the opposite of quietly captivating, namely over-the-top and unrealistic. I quite like Binoche (and Depardieu), but this was a really big downer as a whole. Pretty disappointed here and being one myself I cannot even recommend it to Binoche's fans as they will maybe dislike it as much as I did. It is nowhere near real failure territory, but it's also nowhere near being among the better or even best French films from 2017. A country I love in terms of filmmaking.

It is a story of a middle aged woman Isabelle, a divorc\u00e9e who seeks a meaningful love with a spicy intimate relationship. She meets and have short relationships with couple of men but ended up only with illusion. Isabelle is just a woman like any other, who needs love care and sex in a normal manner. But the men she meets with quite different personas are huge mismatches to her love expectations and desires. Juliette Binoche is the centerfold of this movie, taking command of her character Isabelle rendering great stamina to the character. There is no doubt about Binoche's awesome acting talents and beauty and she keeps her legend in the movie by giving a very vibrant intensity to Isabelle's character. She laughs, she cries, she suffers, she daydreams, she's angry, she fights - all these moments are exceptionally portrayed by Binoche like a fish swimming in the water. All men portrayed are skilled actors and have done justice to their characters.Director Claire Denis does a great job. She coordinates a great screenplay with great acting and editing. She manages the opening sex scene very well in which high intimacy running wild between the couple but something is seriously missing kind of idea successfully transmitted to the audience. Denis uses close up techniques quite successfully, particularly of Isabelle's facial reflections, to display the complexity of her character. Music is appropriate and suits most of the scenes. The balance between the close-up shots with wide angles speaks a lot about a good cinematographer. My only complaint is about the end scene where Isabelle meets the fortune teller and when he starts a pretty boring 10-15 minutes 'analysis' about her love life and the men she have had affairs with. Total waste of time and his monotonous boring voice kills half of the good mood you acquired since the beginning of the movie. Denis should have left that analysis be done by the audience, on their own way rather than narrated through a dull character.

While there, she falls in love with a woman she knew from the past. Lelio builds a stirring portrait of an Orthodox Jewish family that feels both close-knit and intricate at the same time. The culture of such a community is depicted in thoughtful detail without ever overshadowing the story's primary motifs and motivations. The film's script is uniquely written and mixes intense family drama with moments of dry humor or dramatic elements of a somewhat lighter tone. For those concerned that such shifts in the writing could make the film fear uneven, fear not: the narrative always feels satisfying from beginning to end. The film is able to use writing to generate genuine emotional power, although it takes time to build up to such a crescendo in the movie's quietly moving finale.As far as the acting is concerned, fans of Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams will not be disappointed here. Both actresses are outstanding in their respective roles, although I will say Weisz is slightly better. She is able to show a genuine range of acting technique in her role, and remains captivating for viewers to watch from beginning to end. My only real criticism of this film is that the pacing can be rather spotty at times, and can sometimes be slower than it needs to be given audiences' abilities to absorb plot details. While the film never feels boring or annoying at all (unless, of course, one only wants to watch explosions and CGI when you go to the movies,) audiences sometimes feel a bit ready to move on with the narrative before a specific moment in the film may progress. Otherwise, this is a great and thoughtful drama that addresses thought-provoking issues in the world today (religion, sexuality, and family) while boldly challenging audiences to consider their own responses to such issues themselves.

Michael learns that there is corruption everywhere he looks, but goes along with Pasha's \"don't rock the boat\" philosophy because Pasha wants to keep his job and also to insure the funding continues for the Program. This is really NOT an entertaining story. It's more like a documentary about the corruption within the United Nations, and sometimes it's difficult to follow characters that come and go and we are not sure what they do except to say most are up to no good. All you really have to do is to follow Michael and his take on everything. Remember, he took the job to make a difference in the world, but is constrained by Pasha and his don't rock the boat philosophy. Michael's change of heart started with Michael befriending and defending Nashim (Belcim Bilgin) a Kurdish woman who fears for her life if she is found out to be Kurdish in Iraq. After the attack by the US on Iraq, Michael sees the opportunity to get the evidence for all the corruption that involves many well known companies and other countries who greased Saddam's hand. Ben Kingsley plays Pasha perfectly and we all know he is guilty and we wonder how Michael will expose him and all the rest. And this is where the major backstabbing takes place because Pasha is found guilty as well. Pasha admits to Michael later on that this was well-played by Michael. Notable: Jacqueline Bisset as Christina Dupre, who is opposed to the Food for Oil program because she knows the program is corrupt and all the food never gets to the people and worse the drugs that are supposed to help cure illness are so out of date many deaths come about because of that.

Director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody first collaborated on the filming of her debut script JUNO in 2007. Four years later they made YOUNG ADULT with Charlize Theron, and now all three reunite for this latest tip of the cap to motherhood and self-care. Simpatico is the word that comes to mind here with the perfect lineup of writer, director and actress. The biggest question is how to label it. Some will call it a comedy, while others will proclaim it a serious drama. As with much of life, there is a bit of laughter, a touch of drama, and a dash of most every emotion.Ms. Theron stars as Marlo, mother of three. There is 8/9 year old daughter Sarah (Lia Frankland, 6 year old son Jonah (Asher Miles Fallica) who lands on the autistic spectrum, and now an unplanned newborn that threatens to rock a family already barely getting through each day. Sarah is a lovely sister and daughter, but the typical adolescent insecurities are magnified by her getting lost in the shuffle due to her two more needy siblings. Jonah gets booted from mainstream kindergarten by a principal who labels him \"quirky\" ... an awkward description people use when they are trying to be polite (even though it's exactly the opposite). Ron Livingston plays Marlo's husband Drew, a traveling businessman who, though a nice guy and loving father, is clueless to the stresses of running the homestead. Also in the mix is Craig (Mark Duplass), Marlo's brother who is equal parts wealthy and smug. When Craig offers the gift of a night-nanny to Marlo, she is tempted, but her pride gets in the way as she compares herself to the 'cupcake' super moms who always seem to have their act together. Ultimately, the relentless pressure and sleep deprivation, bring the young night-nanny Tully (Mackenzie Davis) into the home. She and Marlo hit it off immediately leading Marlo (and us) to question if Tully is too good to be true.As Tully entrenches herself, it becomes clear that her value is to Marlo more than the baby. The two ladies become friends, and Marlo confesses her fears and insecurities as Tully acts as a life coach encouraging her through some tough moments. Despite the surreal feel to these interactions, Diablo Cody's dialogue crackles with cynicism and realism. The quips we've come to expect from her writing are delivered by her best developed character to date. There is a depth to Marlo, and her exchanges with Tully take us places a teenage JUNO couldn't possibly.Charlize Theron proves again that she is truly an elite actress when she commits to a role. Her 50 lb weight game adds the necessary realism, but it's her emotional teetering that is most impressive. She is like a supermodel who also plays rugby - a rare blend of beauty, talent and skill. Mackenzie Davis is a revelation. She holds her own in every scene and it's quite interesting to see her free-spirited modern day Mary Poppins with tats.If a previous movie has dealt with the challenge and stress of motherhood with this level of depth and realism, it doesn't come to mind. The movie kind of creeps up on you with a message regarding the importance of dealing with lost youth, while also never losing sight of yourself as an individual ... all with incisive humor and pulling no punches on being an overwhelmed mom. Just don't call it quirky.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Marlo is a mother of 2 with a third on the way who has a young special needs son called \"quirky\" by the school system.He's seemingly on the autism spectrum but much like the move's handling of this mental illness and what comes later, \"Tully\" isn't exactly attuned on the specifics of mental disorders.No, this is a movie about motherhood, a role Charlize Theron gained 50 pounds to portray accurately, so she's looking at Oscar, and right now she seems like the definite frontrunner.Marlo seems like she's carrying 10 pounds of stress weight per every physical pound. When she lets her kids break the screen time rule, you know it's just so she can grab precious peace minutes. Plus there's mental toll. \"Tully\" does an awesome job of showing a woman who essentially became a sexless caregiver and is now just broken as anything else. She's told about night nannys, which downside is having a stranger care for your baby, but you get uninterrupted sleep without having to push a finger of whiskey in your kid's mouth so it seems like a winner. The nanny turns out to be Tully, played by Halt and Catch Fire's Mackenzie Davis. She's nurturing, she cleans the house, she makes you feel special, she makes you want a Tully of your own.Yes she seems too good to be true, addressing not just the kid's issues but Marlo's as well. It leads to some funny stuff, like a sex therapy three-way. It's funny but but also makes you think about mom and what she's given up to do what she does, and even with a crutch like Tully, that's a whole lot.If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The film is not going to make you want to run out and become a mother but it also paints a more real look on how motherhood can be hard, stressful, seemingly impossible at times, but ultimately rewarding. It's not your glossy, magical look on motherhood, falsely advertised in most film and TV. I can't say much more on it without giving away the plot which needs to be seen for itself.

At first, it seemed to be a peek into the daily life of a mother, with a heartwarming note about ditching pride and accepting help. The second half, however, descended through a series of strange scenes to an utterly bizarre finale.

{"imdbId": "tt3203528", "movieTitle": "Bad Samaritan", "title": "Bad Samaritan Plays it too Safe", "author": "patrickdangersessoms", "postedDate": "4 May 2018", "reviewContent": "'Bad Samaritan' is a movie that I've been looking forward to for a few months. Ever since David Tennant gave his incredible performance as Kilgrave on the Marvel Netflix series Jessica Jones. The idea of him playing a totally demented psychopath had me giddy with anticipation. However, when it comes to this film that's about where the fun ends. Even with David Tennant playing the big bad wolf, he stumbles too much to save 'Bad Samaritan' from being, well, a bad movie.I really wanted to like 'Bad Samaritan', especially because I'm a sucker for a good horror movie that can make your skin crawl. There are definitely some moments in the film that will make audiences jump and cringe. However, a lot of those scenes that make you cringe are the ones where David Tennant's American accent starts to slip. I'm not sure why they decided to make his character American, possibly to make Robert Sheehan's Irish accent stand out more, but it's definitely not one of Tennant's strong suits. There are plenty of other things that are cringeworthy in 'Bad Samaritan' other than the occasional accent slip. Brandon Boyce tries to create a creepy serial character to act as the menacing villain of the movie, but fails miserably when it comes to his background. Tennant's character, Cale Erendreich, is a unimaginably rich trust fund brat who was so obsessed with horses that breaking them no longer thriller him. So, he took to breaking humans much like horses. It's a premise for a serial killer that feels more suited to being a 'Criminal Minds' psycho of the week than a big screen villain. Even ignoring the motives behind Erendreich's character, he never comes across as threatening. Sure he has money to throw at problems and proves to be incredibly cunning, but he lacks the right kind of presence for something like this. His performance though it incredibly chilling at certain times. There's no question that Tennant is a great actor, but the character he's given to work with is kind of pathetic.The title of the film itself comes from the protagonist who is vallet that burgles people's homes while they're at dinner. Sheehan manages to make the character charming at times, but he feels incredibly out of place when it comes to this movie. For some reason the character is made Irish, which really doesn't add much to the overall story at all. More than that though he seems incredibly unsuited for the situation he finds himself in. The script makes him more bumbling than he needs to be when it comes to trying to convince the cops or those around him that Erendreich is a monster walking among them. It's just another one of the horror movie tropes that I can't stand.Then again, despite the fact that 'Bad Samaritan' is riddled with cliches, it does get a few things right. With Tennant more focused on psychologically breaking his victims rather than just killing them off when they become problematic, it allows the stakes to continuously rise for the hero. His life is slowly taken apart by a man who is not only smart, but has the resources to destroy the struggling millennial. It's during this sequences of events that Tennant manages to do his best work. The scenes where he gives his maniacal rants though seem forced and cumbersome. In a lot of ways, Tennant does his best work in 'Bad Samaritan' when he isn't talking. There isn't a lot in 'Bad Samaritan' that we haven't seen before in one way or another. It's filled with the same cliches from so many other horror movies/ thrillers and plays it safe for much of the film. In a way though, that's good because it pretty much follows a paint by numbers when it comes to what audiences like from these sorts of things. Though it stumbles from time to time because it tries to pound square pegs into round plot holes, there is enough salvageable here to at least let fans of the genre have some fun while watching it. Of course, if you're looking for something really scary then you're better off just skipping this one.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

So yes its been done many times before, person (or in this case; people) break in to someones house for some ulterior motive, only to discover the home owner is either hiding something or is some sort of killer. But it throws a little extra into the formula, some works, the emphasis on the killer and his story was refreshing. But is it scary? Is it a horror movie? Because lately so called \"horror\" movies are indeed not scary at all. And as far as this film is concerned, I'm not sure what I want to say, because some of it was effective, and some of it wasn't. First of all, I like how they expanded on the typical story line they were telling, and without giving to much away, it creates this admittedly tense cat and mouse chaotic situation for all parties involved, so I liked how it just didn't stick 100% to the \"Rear Window\" and \"Disturbia\" formulas.But was it scary? I'd say it was in places and was not in some, it was as simple as that for me. Some of the scenes/situations/jumps got me, and I got a little tense, but some other scenes just didn't do it for me, maybe because I'm so desensitized to brutal horror movies. The acting was also hit and miss, some actors did a fine job while others, were just... meh... And to be fair some of the good acting added to the intensity. I also didn't like some of the editing choices. I liked the color scheme of the film, the dark and deep colors, something you would expect from a James Wan or Hammer Films movies.

It sounds like two cartoon characters, but in fact they are the nicknames of Gino and B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, the two leads in Michael R. Roskam's new movie 'Le Fid\u00e8le'. Already in the first five minutes of the film, Gigi and Bibi fall in love. This love affair is the main theme of the film. It's not an easy affair, since Bibi is the daughter of a wealthy business man, who supports her race car driving career, while Gigi doesn't have any relatives and earns a living by robbing banks and cash transit vans.At first, Gigi hides his real occupation and pretends to be a car salesman. When he no longer can hide the truth, he is quick to point out that they both have a lot in common, in spite of their different backgrounds. He likes the risk-taking and the danger that comes with his job, exactly as she does with hers. For Belgian moviegoers, the film has an extra appeal. Roskam has based his story on the lives of a well-known gang of criminals, who were household names in the 1990's. They captured the attention of the media and the public at large, because they combined extremely audacious and violent robberies with a glamorous lifestyle. Roskam shows in this movie how such brutal criminals could at the same time be loving husbands and friends. Gigi loves Bibi, and he is extremely loyal to his criminal friends, but he has no respect for the feelings of his victims. Matthias Schoenaerts plays this complex character very convincingly, and Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos is quite effective as the slightly naive girl whose love for Gigi is unconditional. The last part of the film is different from the rest. The love affair, having been firmly established, is no longer the central theme. Instead, we see a quick succession of increasingly dramatic events, which sometimes feels a bit exaggerated. But the beautiful end scene compensates for this. This long take is technically simple, but very clever and creative from a cinematographic point of view. And the very last shot even more so. It's these kinds of scenes that show how original a film maker Roskam can be.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

With this out of the way, let's start with a short synopsis of the film without spoiling any big plot points.The movie tells the story of Gigi and Bibi, two people with completely different backgrounds who fall in love in Brussels. Gigi (Matthias Schoenaerts) is a gangster who robs banks while he pretends to be a car salesman. He was abused as a child,t he only people he could rely on in his childhood were his friends. Later on he started robbing banks with this same group of friends. Bibi (Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos) on the other hand comes from a loving and upper class family. Because of the support of her father she could become a professional racer. From here, the story unfolds.The performance by Matthias Schoenaerts is, once again, spot on. He delivers a perfect bilingual performance as Gigi the gangster who eventually sees the light. The other actors as, especially Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, shine as well. The story is divided in 3 parts, all with their own theme. The first is called 'Gigi' and is about the evasion Gino uses on his loved ones. The second, 'Bibi', shows the kindness and effort Bibi puts into her lover and the ways she tries him to make up for himself. The third and final chapter shows the redemption of Gino after facing some serious setbacks.The movie is thrilling and touching at the same time, not leaving you untouched for one moment. Above all the last scene of the movie where the camera flies through the streets of Brussels, metaphorically saying that Gigi roams the streets of Brussels with as only purpose to find the lover he lost.Highly recommend it. 9/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Still too much money.The first third of the movie is promising. There are impressive scenes and stunts. A twist I didn't see coming in the shape of a character who was not at all what she seemed. It's (mostly) engaging as it works towards a climax. After that, the story is as stagnant as the lives of the main characters.Where at first I was waiting for the female lead to come to her senses, as the movie progresses it becomes clear neither of the lead characters have any sense. They are two-dimensional and boring. Clich\u00e9 is heaped upon clich\u00e9 to propel the story forward. Except it doesn't, it just turns the movie into a weird mix of crime- and melodrama with a whiff of kitchen sink realism.It seems like the filmmaker wanted to tell a story of obsessional love. But since there is no substance to the relationship of the couple the entire movie revolves around, there is no substance to the film. Every sex scene (supposedly to show their passion for each other) consists of Schoenaerts mechanically drilling his much younger co-star. They have nothing to talk about and the sex only gets him off. How is that any motivation for the girl to turn herself into a self-sacrificing saint? How is that guy worth her or my time? (And did the women's lib movement skip Belgium?)Another theme in the movie is the tragic, abusive background of Schoenaerts' character. How he himself can't explain his own actions. It all reeks of literary movements like determinism and naturalism. As if he can't help it, it's his background that turned him into a criminal. It could have been excellent material to flesh out a character. Instead it just leads to Schoenaerts making the same face over and over again. If you're going to make a movie about dynamic characters robbing banks and racing cars maybe next time don't mix it with a tale of pre-determined fate that has people stuck like a hamster in a wheel. One pretty much cancels out the other.The movie looks much better than most movies that come out of the Netherlands (good for you, Belgium). There were definitely people involved who knew what they were doing in terms of the look of the movie, the action sequences, the locations, the way the camera is handled. But ultimately this is a crap story that wastes the talent of its cast and crew.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It's action-suspense done RIGHT, with plenty of surprises and reversals of fortune ... and a LOT of blood. It's in the finest French Grand Guignol tradition, alongside such films as LANCELOT OF THE LAKE, MARTYRS and HAUTE TENSION.Although transpiring in a decidedly more hospitable climate and over a much smaller area, the film has unmistakable similarities to THE REVENANT. Both feature a main character left for dead (in this case, the gorgeous Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz) who manages to self-recover through agonizingly painful procedures to embark on a payback quest. Her transformation from a philandering husband's sex kitten mistress to a semiautomatic-wielding vengeance machine (think Lolita to Furiosa) is most impressive.The film was written and directed by a woman, Coralie Fargeat, and she definitely makes a convincing case that women can play hardball as well as men can. Between this and Lone Scherfig's THE RIOT CLUB, I'm getting impressed with female directors' ability to make films that appeal to my demanding aesthetic.The plot is straightforward, but the execution is anything but paint-by-numbers. It features solid acting, impressive production values and deft execution that keeps you 100% engaged.

When the woman of the group gets violated by one of the group and wants out of the party, her lover (though a married man) pushes her off a cliff to her death, but they fail to see her dead as she survives and hunts down the three in a brutal fight for 'revenge'.With the plot description given, the film overall has the same old clich\u00e9's but what makes Revenge unique is it's style and tone that's thankfully done perfect with its cinematography and camera work. There are moments of surreal imagery, graphic wounds and bloody kills uncovered on screen and shades of The Revenant as the heroine finds herself, recovers and arms up to fight as much as Leo DiCaprio did in that film.The acting range holds firmly, while there's no chance of Oscar winners here in the cast, its heroine and villains move the story with each having a soul purpose to the story and justifying with the audience on what they did and who was the worst of the bad. The soundtrack composed by an music artist known as Rob is a sound for the ears and makes the film so stylish in sound as much as we see on screen.Overall, this is not something that will be forgotten overnight as Revenge is a brutal ride of violence, blood and survival. Though the clich\u00e9 has been done again and again, it is given something new here and has earned my viewing pleasure and respect.4.5/5 - Nick Having heard so many great things about this movie I decided to check it out. The results are now in and it is true...it Is a great movie! You can't take your eyes off the screen, it's so visually stunning that you can't help but to admire the beautiful art done here! The director of this sick, twisted revenge flick (who's a female) does a great job considering the fact this is her first film. She has already proved herself to be extremely talented. The acting was good by everyone involved. The three main male villains were all equally evil in their own way. The victims boyfriend was definitely the leader and the main cause of all of this! This film is very similar to \"I spit on your grave\", but that doesn't mean it's not a good film. It's a very hard film to watch, but it's also very difficult to ignore! It's a great movie with a message that females are really strong people and can do just as much damage as men. See it in theaters. It's well worth your time! Lots of blood as well!

Held captive it breaks teeth trying to smash through the enclosing wall. Two such independent spirits meet on the dusky seashore. Eschewing her birthday party and straight-laced family in favor of a nightclub, Moll is in a desperate situation in a variety of ways when she first encounters Pascal along a remote section of beach. There is a series of missing and presumed murdered local young women in the news and so this is no time for her to be alone with an obvious outcast and loner, yet internally Moll craves an escape and adventure from her stuffy, arranged life. She has either encountered a kindred soul or a beast.The twists and turns of this riveting and perilous romance play with notions of trust. This first feature from director Michael Pearce is thrilling in its authenticity. Pearce reveals in a rousing way that there is darkness all around, within as well as external to ourselves. The call of adventure both repels and appeals (it repels because it is so difficult to break from what we are familiar with and accustomed to), and the story and actors heighten this inherent tension from beginning to end. Other layers of the film are appealing as well including the stimulating sound of surf and appropriately eerie chords when a gruesome scene is discovered, crime investigators who inspire fear as well as trust, and intriguing chemistry in the romance. Some scenes are a little clunky and disjointed, but not so bad. The metaphor at the beginning about the killer whales was fantastic and I wish there were more such metaphors.

But that, sadly, is the case with 'Beast', for writer/director Michael\u00a0Pearce did not realise when enough is enough. On three or four occasions, just as the film reaches what seems like a natural conclusion, on it lurches for another few scenes to the next false stop.It does not help matters that neither the plot nor the characters are original (this in itself need not be a sin, but when a film seems so much longer than its sub-two\u00a0hours running time it is another point against it). Moll (Jessie\u00a0Buckley) is the down-trodden daughter of a brittle mother who clearly thinks less of Moll than of her other daughter (who upstages Moll at her birthday party by announcing her own pregnancy with twins) and her son (who expects Moll to baby-sit his teenaged daughter while he goes out on the pull). The main male character is Pascal (Johnny\u00a0Flynn): maverick, son of the soil, poacher, loner... of *course* Moll is going to fall for him. But hang about: there is a murderer on the loose, who rapes and kills young girls. Could it be... possibly... the case that Pascal is somehow involved? And what about the Shameful Secret from Moll's past: how will that effect her judgement? One by one the clich\u00e9 plot devices roll out: Moll lies to the police about Pascal's whereabouts when a further murder occurs; she has violent flashbacks relating to her Shameful Secret; Pascal turns up to a posh family gathering and gets thrown out for wearing jeans; when he is hauled in for questionning the community unthinkingly turn against him; and so on and so forth.However, there are two major plus points: the first is the acting, which is good. Leading lady Buckley (channelling Honeysuckle Weeks) expertly pulls on the viewer's heartstrings as Moll seeks freedom in the arms of one who may ultimately treat her worse than her family do. The script gives Flynn less scope to add depth to his character, but he does what he can. Geraldine\u00a0James is fun as Moll's mother, and there's a very good single-scene cameo from Olwen\u00a0Fou\u00e9r\u00e9 as a police detective.The second plus point is the make-up: this is not the sort of film that demands rubber prosthetics for aliens or similar, but Flynn's skin is coloured to look appropriately weather-beaten and the injuries resulting from a car-crash are wince-inducing without being overly gory.

A good cast and that there are some fine recent film debuts added further to the interest. On the most part, 'Beast' did not disappoint. Not quite one of the best films of the year by all means and not quite a masterpiece, but far from one of the worst, it doesn't waste its concept and it deserves a wider release and sizeable audience. It certainly should have been more widely advertised, but being released at the same time as more publicised films that have perhaps a wider audience and films people are more likely to go and see has probably hurt it a bit. Just my present stance on things at the moment and may be proven wrong. 'Beast' could have been somewhat better. It does run a little too long perhaps, a few of the metaphors are laid too thickly and some of the lighting is a touch too dark.The biggest problem for me was the climax, which was rather too melodramatic and also somewhat improbable. However, 'Beast' is beautifully and atmospherically filmed and designed and Pearce makes a more than credible directing debut where the atmosphere is momentum is kept going and one is kept guessing and engrossed. It's also eerily scored. Writing is intelligent and thought-provoking with a little wit, subtle tension and emotion. The story is absorbing, with a tight structure and a deliberate but also taut pace. There is an element of suspense and a real sense of dark dread that 'Beast' does a great job bringing out. While the mystery elements are always intriguing, even with some purposeful ambiguity in spots, there is more of an emphasis on the character relationships and interaction, handled intricately and sensitively with no hint of soap-opera, excelling in making the characters engaging and interesting. Jessie Buckley is excellent as the vulnerable protagonist and Geraldine James is good value. Johnny Flynn doesn't have as interesting a role, slightly on the dull side, but he does what he can and is hardly charisma-light. It is a well acted film. Overall, a very well done film with great atmosphere as well as brains and heart. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I have to say that I went in not really expecting much and came away really impressed. I woke up this morning with elements of the story still running through my mind It was a very interesting story well told. It's mostly a movie about LA but the opening, which take place in a small Southern town, tells us all we need to about the 'back story' in just a few moments with very few words. Everything centers on a character named Early, played by John Carroll Lynch. He is a man of few words and so much of the movie's style revolves around that. However, Early is book-ended by two very different, but equally 'outspoken', women. In fact, sometimes both seem incapable of knowing when a bit of silence would be appropriate. However, a third woman is always in the background. We never see her but, in one of the loveliest scenes in the film, we hear her words which are simple, clear and affectionate. I think that perhaps dealing with the loud and theatrical personality of the woman with whom he is now fascinated, is more of a stretch for Early than dealing with her gender. A word about Matt Bomer: If memory serves there was something of an uproar from trans activists when he was cast in this part. I admit that I was somewhat skeptical that he could pull it off. However I have to say that Freda was a memorable, and totally believable, screen character. I suppose there was some Matt Bomer in her somewhere but I didn't really see it or feel it. It was an amazing piece of work. Bomer is an out gay actor who was totally convincing playing a straight romantic lead in White Collar, and who then moved on to break my heart playing closeted Felix in The Normal Heart. I can't wait for The Boys in the Band, opening soon on Broadway. \n \nThis movie has a lot of supportive things to say about Freda, an attractive and interesting trans woman. In my opinion it would be a shame if trans activists were to decide to shoot themselves in the foot..... to shoot the entire trans community in the foot actually..... by trying to deny it an audience. I might point out that Boys in the Band was attacked as being an 'incorrect' depiction of gay life when it originally played.

It's an upbeat, colourful and very imaginative movie full of joy that is sure to put a big smile on your face. With a cute, cartoonish animation style to go with its generally light-hearted atmosphere, this is an absolutely delightful watch from start to finish, and although some of its intended deeper meanings may get lost in the process, you're guaranteed to have a great time with Lu Over The Wall.So, let's start off by reaffirming that point once again: this film is really enjoyable. It may not be a moving piece of animated artwork, nor is it a constantly riveting and exciting action adventure, but it's comfortable enough in being a light-hearted and imaginative fantasy adventure with a great sense of humour, and that was absolutely enough to have me grinning ear to ear throughout.If there's anything that sums up what this film is really like, it's the animation style. Rather than being a hand-painted extravaganza like a Ghibli movie or a detailed and hardcore-styled anime, Lu Over The Wall is simply a bright and lovely film to look at. With a very soft yet hugely colourful visual style that matches the overall film's light-hearted vibes, the delightful animation here is enough to have you smiling within seconds.What's more is that this film doesn't shy away from being excessively cute, and goes so far to the point that it doesn't feel all that cheesy. Lu, the mermaid, is absolutely adorable from the moment she first appears, and that actually helps to make the story a lot more investing, as you care enough about her as an adorable baby-like character that you support her and those around her to succeed in the story.And although there are some elements of the middle school students' story that feels a little cheesy, it's all done with a great sense of fun and humour, meaning that you can sit back and look past some of the sillier elements of the story in exchange for nearly two hours of solid entertainment.A lot of people have pointed out the similarities in plot between this film and Ponyo, and although that's undeniable, I'll tell you why I think Lu Over The Wall brings this story to life even better. It's a film that's completely gleeful in everything it does, knowing full well that it's filled to the brim with some ridiculous fantasy elements, but taking that in its stride to make a properly enjoyable movie that all ages can enjoy and smile at. It's never too serious about itself, and rarely gets bogged down in its storytelling like Ponyo does, and that's why I think it's a perfectly pleasant movie that you can't miss.With all that said, there are a few issues that I do have with this film. On the whole, it works brilliantly as a light-hearted and enjoyable adventure, but there are moments when the film tries to say something a little deeper with regards to mob mentality, segregation and exploitation. Some of those themes come through better than others, but in general, they're not covered strongly enough in the story to make the desired impact, instead getting lost within the sea of colours and smiles that really make this film special.What's more is that the film's final act is a little too drawn out for its own good. As fun as the finale is, it really feels like it goes on for a very long time, even suffering from multiple different endings all being crammed into one climax. It doesn't have a huge impact on the smile factor, but there are moments when the plot becomes a little tiresome.Overall, however, I had huge fun with Lu Over The Wall. Colourful, happy, imaginative and fantastically light-hearted, it's a wonderful animation that will definitely have you smiling from start to finish.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

I'm far from being an anime or animation expert but I can say that I've watched a fair amount of Japanese anime, films or series. The overall style of the anime is certainly quite different from what I'm used to and that felt refreshing.What I liked - The music worked really well with the anime and different scenes. I'm actually a tiny bit disappointed that they didn't exploit that aspect a bit more. The character design was simple, a bit hazy at times but it worked very well with the animation style that I enjoyed very much. The film also dares to do interesting things with animation, colours, visuals in general and that is very welcome. There are good vibrations in this film and overall it made me feel good. They also manage to make Lou, the siren, a very likable character, at least that's how I experienced it. Finally the whole mystery/mythology/mystic aspect of the Siren felt captivating to me at times and certainly entertaining.What I liked less - I once again have a problem with character development as I didn't relate enough to the main character. He still had his moments but I needed a bit more from him for this film to have a significant emotional impact on me. The second thing that kinda disturbed me is how random some parts of this movies felt to me. Like it lacked some kind adhesive substance to make it all stick together in a more coherent form. Finally, the way the the main stakes of the movie are handled and ultimately resolved didn't really feel satisfactory to me. That last issue may come from the fact that the audience targeted could be a very young one (I'm 30) but it felt a bit \"easy\" and oversimplified to me. The way people react to the Sirens was also not realistic at all given that it's taking place in a similar world than ours. Then again, if the movie was intended for a very young audience that could explain that problem.In the end it was a good experience and I'd recommend it for young kids or if you want to watch a rather simple story with interesting elements and good vibrations!Verdict : 7.4/10.

Then McEwan starts to write new scenes that were merely summarised in the book, and all bets are off. The first three \u2212 dealing with Edward and his family \u2212 are minor but quite satisfying, especially the one with his father, and the fourth is an absolute belter, a slightly obvious but incredibly affecting scene set in a record shop in 1975.If only they'd ended the film there, as the next has Edward explaining not just the moral but also the text of the story, before a closing sequence set in 2007 that has some of the worst Old Person Make-Up that I've seen: he looks like he's been badly burned, and the rest of the cast are only slightly less ridiculous. Yes, the moment that it's all leading up to got to me, even while I knew I was being manipulated, but from Edward's risible stance at the crease onwards, it's an embarrassing and completely unnecessary coda.Look, lads, you've got a while till the general release, how about heading back and having another go?

This is a talky, dialogue- driven, and unsettling thriller that makes you both empathize with its characters as well as send a chill down your spine at times.The film's deeply intellectual and serious commentary on matters of religion and environmentalism is profound and thoughtful. This movie will likely not be suited for mainstream audiences desiring cheap entertainment, but serious viewers looking to be challenged in their thought processes will have much material to ponder during--and after--they view the movie. The acting is very strong, as Schrader commands his cast into giving low-key but quietly powerful and resonant performances. The standouts in the cast are Ethan Hawke's lead role as well as Amanda Seyfried and Cedric the Entertainer in the supporting cast. A gripping, dark (almost relentlessly so at times) tone keeps the viewer engrossed in the film. While this isn't a horror film (despite containing disturbing content and moments,) the film's simple score is incredibly chilling and gets under one's skin more than almost any other film's score I have witnessed in a long time.My only complaints about this film are found in the third act. A dreamlike, surrealistic scene inspired by impressionism that involves the protagonist and Seyfried's character feels out of place given the grim tone deeply rooted in realism. Additionally, a quick and highly abrupt cut in the film's finale feels disappointing and almost like the equivalent of a 'cop-out' in film editing. It did not positively impact how I viewed the film's ending. But other than these concerns, this is a very well-made and serious drama designed to quietly shock audiences into a state of reflection on the world today as we know it. 8/10", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Perhaps the most powerful clip was during the first week of his show in February, 1968 (at the peak of the Vietnam War) when his show starts out encouraging that walls be torn down. His message remains amazingly timely today. It also underscores the importance of PBS - which the films shows Rogers defending successfully at a Congressional hearing.

The film examines what has happened to our food industry in the last 40-years, as we've transitioned from traditional farming to huge industrial farms. The book was written as an effort for Foer to decide whether his newborn child should eat meat or not. The film was written and directed by Christopher Dillon Quinn, and it's narrated and produced by Oscar winning actress (and filmmaker) Natalie Portman. The documentary had it's world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival last September, where it received a standing ovation. I saw it at a film festival in Portland, followed by a Q&A with the director there. I definitely had severely mixed feelings about the film. The movie examines what has happened to our food industry over the last forty years, as it's transitioned from traditional farming to massive factory farms. The filmmakers interview multiple farmers, and question them on how this change has affected them (many have been left in financial ruins). It also shows us (through undercover footage primarily) the horrific treatment of animals as a result. Portman also beautifully narrates the film, throughout, as well. I saw the movie with a group of vegan 'animal rights' activist friends, and they were pretty upset by the overall message of the film. They feel that it promotes the myth of 'humanely' raised meat and dairy, and it encourages a transition back to more traditional farming, rather than veganism. I didn't feel that was the overall message (from my biased point of view) when I first watched it, but I can definitely see why they feel that way. I still saw it as a movie which primarily promotes veganism. There's a lot of important educational information in it, including lots of animal abuse footage, and it definitely (without a doubt) paints factory farming in a very negative and horrific light. The film has a lot of flaws still though (obviously), and it's certainly far from a great movie.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

This time it's the Zellner Brothers, and they double down on the unusual genre elements by making it a farcical western. But if you're down for some off-beat cinema, what the Zellner's do here is pretty fantastic.As farces do, the story here takes some pretty drastic bait and switch turns as it sets up Pattinson's character as the traditional western hero - yet still gives you signs that all is not right with this guy. Indeed, he's a very bad man. And things get very tragic and slightly disturbing when he meets his love - the damsel who is not in distress until he shows up.I'll refrain from further spoilers, but I feel like people react to farces like the directors or writers don't know what they're doing. They do. And this one is a good one in that it packs more than one tragic punch by the end. The characters in this movie long to be part of something they can't and being part of.

So i'm tired of the typical approach. Who has something new for me?Well, the Zellers deliver a comedic western that kept me involved the whole way through. Starting with an unusual looking character arriving in a rowboat with a crate holding a miniature palomino horse. He shows up in a town full of characters that make him seem almost normal. It turns out he's there to meet a \"preacher\" and to find and marry the girl of his dreams. In the film intro we see him dancing with this girl. Well, it's been a couple years since his contact with her and his focus is such that he hasn't considered the girl might not be of like mind. When that turns out to be the case, it turns out he's become so obsessed with this marriage he's become downright delusional. Things, to put it mildly, don't go his way.The Zellers seem to have a deft touch with delusional characters. In Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter, Kumiko is beautifully portrayed with great empathy. Here, our \"hero\" is shown to be equally possessed, and while both characters meet their demise, I felt great empathy for both. Unlike Kumiko, our \"hero\" finds out what he wants will not be his. Even though he had no reasonable expectation of success, I still felt empathy for him. The \"Damsel\" was played straight by Mia Wasikowska with no humor coming directly from her, and you can't blame her. I was reminded of the Coen Brothers True Grit and the way Hailee Steinfeld played Mattie Ross -- all business (even though her wicked sarcasm did elicit a few laughs). It created a great contrast to the rest of the not-so-usual characters. I saw this film at The Baltimore Film Festival and can't wait to see it again. I know there were a number of funny spots and sight gags I missed the first time through. I also appreciated it for the Zellers' breaking of traditional western genre molds. While not as high on my list as the Coen's True Grit or Fred Schepisi's Barbarosa, Damsel is a worth addition to my \"oddball western\" list. It's also a worthy follower to the wonderful Kumiko. I'm going to keep my eye on the Zellers and can't wait for their next film!", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

It is a remarkable cinematic journey as she revisits those she has photographed for previous projects which have often focused on excessive wealth.\nGreenfield eloquently captures the decaying of the American Dream as a form of corrupt capitalism has eaten away at American idealism and replaced it with a form extreme narcistic materialism. In many ways this film explains - while barely mentioning him - how this country could elect corrupt narcissist as its President. It describes a country where beauty, sex, fame, and status have all become commodities on sale to the highest bidder\nGreenfield takes it a step further by intriguingly adding herself and her own family as part of the story and suggesting that her careerism is also part of the problem. The photography is beautiful and provides a powerful narrative of the collapse of the American Dream. Highly recommended to all who care about the future of America.

Before being transferred to a British jail he spent three\u00a0years in a Thai prison; it is that time that is covered here.After we see Moore's arrest, the prison movie requisite rape scene (of an unnamed extra) is quickly dealt with and we move on to the meat of the story. Moore swears a lot; gets bullied; starts fights; continues his drug habit; joins the prison boxing team; has a tender, sexual relationship with a 'ladyboy'. Although engrossing, it is all rather unstructured - Moore appears to be the only Western prisoner; the addition of an English-speaking pal to whom he could speak, \u00e0 la John Hurt in 'Midnight Express', would have helped the audience understand what was going on in his mind, even if it would have been factually inaccurate... a voice-over, perhaps? Adding to the confusion, Thai dialogue is not always translated, although this may be a device to highlight Moore's own bewilderment as to what is going on around him (in which case, it succeeded!) And while the fight scenes are extremely fast-paced and violent, the camera gets in so close that at times it is hard to tell who is pummeling who.Fans of leading man Joe Cole - impressively muscular - will be pleased that he rarely wears more than a pair of shorts (and certain sections of his fanbase may also enjoy the sight of him in handcuffs and leg irons). As for his acting, I would not say the role stretches him but he is convincing. Overall this is worth watching - and do keep an eye out for the scene in which the boxing team gather around Moore as he gets his first prison tattoo - it is a wordless, but very powerful, expression of comradeship.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

The problem with it is, though the chronological order is preserved, that the spectator is completely lost with untold names or missing events and you always need to think about what happened before in the movie to finally understand what took place an hour ago, which is completely annihilating the empathy for the characters because you can't feel the same as them because you have no idea what just happened.In addition to that, the scenario have no real purpose, the movie is starting nowhere, and is ending nowhere.

This one disappointed, especially as I remember seeing the superb Camille Claudelle more than twenty years ago. I wanted to get the other half of the story - but felt let down.Two great things about this movie: the use of sepia throughout really locates the movie in time, making it feel oldie worldie. The sets, most of which are inside the artist's studios give one a real feeling of the process of sculpting. The selection of limbs and heads lying around and give the movie a strangely surrealistic air. visually the studios provide a visual backdrop that is every bit as good as that in Parfum. Two things that let this movie down. 1. the lack of a coherent narrative or story line. Its about love found and lost but it moves along at a too-slow pace and scenes seem poorly connected to each other. Vincent Lindon's portrayal of Rodin is also disappointing he mostly seems to wander around his studio looking miserable and lost.

Rodin's role in changing the art of sculpture is reflected by the impressionists with whom he socialises, including Cezanne and Monet, who were likewise challenging the conventions of painting. In the background, literally and figuratively, is the famous \"Gates of Hell\" sculptural group that the master is slowly assembling. In the foreground is his tempestuous relationship with student Camille Claudel, one of the many students/models he beds over the course of the film. Like his \"Balzac\" the film was panned on release (but likely not to be considered a game-changing masterpiece in the future) and although I seemed to have liked it more than most critics, it is undeniably slow-moving and disjointed. Unlike films such as \"Lust for \"Life\" (1956), it does not follow the artist from beginning to end, so anyone without some knowledge of the sculptor will find themselves dropped into the story midpoint with insufficient 'exposition' to immerse themselves in the characters or situations. While a known womaniser, the emphasis on Rodin's flings with his frequently nude (and sometimes not very convincing) models gets in the way of what is interesting: the sculpting. On the plus side, the film is beautifully photographed and I thought that Vincent Lindon (Rodin) and Iz\u00efa Higelin (Camille) were very good (an opinion not shared by all).", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}

Judging by the date, I probably saw this film at the same Sundance screening as the previous reviewer. With its $10 million sale at Sundance three days ago, this movie is sure to get a theatrical release this year, and deservedly so. It may even win the Dramatic jury prize at Sundance in a few days. My mind is dizzy right now with thoughts I want to express about this film - so I will only stick to the essentials. Let me start with this: this \"little\" film (cheekily dubbed as a \"true story\") about the breakdown of the small town of Salem, Massachusetts, will stir up national debates about internet transparency, morality in the digital age, toxic male egos, gun culture, and teenage online delinquency. And that is just scratching the surface.This is a film that can be assaulting on the senses with plenty of teenage sex, gun violence, and excessive blood. This shit is not for everyone, especially viewers over 45. Really, I am a bit overwhelmed. I will say that the story hits a home run. In our heroine, Lily, we find a character arch that begins with strength, then vulnerability, fear, despair, and then finally renewed strength. It is classically Aristotelian in that way. The technical execution is something to behold, with one breathless technocrane/steadicam (step-off) shot - showing with heart-pounding grace how thugs ambush Lily and her friends in a house. The price of admission is worth this scene alone.My biggest critique of the film is that the last one-third of the film differs in form or genre than the rest. Though I am sure this was a deliberate choice which helps the film be entertaining to its targeted youthful viewership, I also feel that this tactic may keep the film from making any lists of great cinematic achievement. The first two-thirds of the film is a gripping tapestry which includes music-video aesthetics, split-screens, driving dance beats and youthful energy - rife with empathetic sensibility. The second half is completely devoid of any empathy in a balls-to-the wall grindhouse or revenge story featuring babes with shiny red jackets enshrouded by guns and seemingly impervious to bullets. Also, enough blood and killings to make you think you are seeing grindhouse B-film from the 70's. What this film does startlingly well is that the audience is willing to let itself be immersed by the lack of empathy and incredulous violence in the last act because by this point the director has earned its trust with the gripping story and the sympathatic plight of the main characters. That Sam Levinson the writer/driector made us make this jump with him is a stroke of --I will say the word-- genius.", "isCriticReview": "false", "likeCount": 0}
